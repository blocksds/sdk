## Windows 🪟

If you are using MinGW, WSL, or any similar environment, you can follow the
Linux instructions, which give you more flexibility.

If you want to install BlocksDS natively, check the instructions
[here](windows).

## Linux 🐧

If you are using Linux, MinGW, WSL, or any similar environment, follow the
instructions [here](linux).

## Docker 🐳

The Docker images of BlocksDS can be used in any OS (including macOS). They
require more disk space than the native installation, but they may be needed if
a native installation isn't possible.

Follow the instructions [here](docker).

> [!NOTE]
>
> **macOS** is not officially supported at this time, as BlocksDS's development
> team lacks the hardware necessary to maintain and validate BlocksDS builds for
> the platform. In addition, the Wonderful toolchain is only officially
> available on Windows- and Linux-based platforms. For the time being, it should
> be possible to make use of the Docker images on this platform, as described
> above. We're looking for help to add this support, you can see more
> information [here](https://github.com/blocksds/sdk/issues/205).

## Build from source 🛠️

This is the option you should use if you want to help develop BlocksDS, or if
you want to always use the cutting edge version of BlocksDS. This is only
available in Linux-like environment.

Follow the instructions [here](from_source).

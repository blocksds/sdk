If you want to report any bugs or suggest new features and make sure they aren't
forgotten, use the Codeberg issue tracker.

If you prefer to chat with other developers in real time, the best way is to
join the gbadev Discord server, where we hang out. This is a community of GBA
game developers, and it has a small section for NDS developent.

If you don't like Discord, or you can't use it for some reason, most of the
channels in the gbadev Discord server are bridged to IRC.

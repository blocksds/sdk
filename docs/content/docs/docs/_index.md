BlocksDS comes with some core libraries and tools that are required to build
programs (or that aren't required, but are very commonly used). All of them are
installed in the path in the environment variable `BLOCKSDS`.

BlocksDS also allows users to install external libraries and tools that aren't
part of the base SDK. They get installed in `BLOCKSDSEXT`.

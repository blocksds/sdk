BlocksDS comes with some core libraries and tools that are required to build
programs (or that aren't required, but are very commonly used). All of them are
installed in the path in the environment variable `BLOCKSDS`.

BlocksDS also allows users to install external libraries that aren't a core part
of the SDK. They get installed in `BLOCKSDSEXT`.

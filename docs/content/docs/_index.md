BlocksDS comes with some core libraries and tools (libnds, grit, DSWiFi,
Maxmod, etc). They are a combination of libraries that are required to build
programs (libnds) and others that aren't required but used in many projects.
All of them are installed in the path specified in the environment variable
`BLOCKSDS`.

BlocksDS also allows users to install external libraries that aren't a core part
of the SDK. They get installed in `BLOCKSDSEXT`.

- The documentation of the **core libraries** of BlocksDS is [here](core_libs).

- There are links to some popular **external libraries** [here](external_libs).

- If you're looking for a list of open source projects to use as reference,

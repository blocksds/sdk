## Version 1.15.5 (2025-11-01)

- libnds:

  - Split `systemShutDown()` to create `systemReboot()`.
  - Clean power management definitions.
  - Un-deprecate ` glTranslate3f32()` because it's used in several projects.
  - Stop writing the NAND CID to arbitrary RAM addresses used by the official
    SDK but not by BlocksDS. @edo9300
  - Stop writing to `REG_VCOUNT` during initialization of the ROM. Thanks to
    @TuxSH for finding the original bug.
  - Add global timer definitions so that other libraries know which timer they
    can use.
  - Ensure that file descriptors passed to `truncate()` are valid FAT
    descriptors.

- DSWiFi:

  - Drop lwIP packets if there isn't enough RAM to allocate a buffer for them
    (instead of crashing in an `assert()`).
  - Add a workaround to prevent IPC buffer overflows.

- SDK:

  - Use the new libnds timer defines in ARM7 templates and examples, as well as
    in DSWiFI, Maxmod and LibXM7.
  - Fixed the orientation of normals for planes in the volumetric shadow
    example. @Mori-TM
  - Improve exit-to-loader test.

## Version 1.15.4 (2025-10-19)

- libnds:

  - `glTranslate3f32()` has been converted from a define to a `static inline`
    function. The define could cause issues if someone was creating a C++
    wrapper with the same name, for example.

- DSWiFi:

  - Don't crash on an `assert()` when sending fragmented lwIP packets.

- SDK:

  - Support unusual `main()` prototypes with 3 arguments instead of two. The
    third argument is set to `NULL`.

## Version 1.15.3 (2025-10-17)

- DSWiFi:

  - IPv6 support has been added. The `ASSOCSTATUS_DHCP` state now waits for an
    IPv4 or an IPv6 address to be available (normally IPv4 is available first).
    Function `Wifi_GetIPv6()` has been added, which lets the caller check if
    there is an available IPv6 address for the DS.
  - In DS mode, only send data packets to the ARM9 by default. Previously all
    management packets were being sent.
  - In DS mode, send multicast packets to lwIP. Previously only packets
    addressed to the console or to the broadcast address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)
    were sent to lwIP, which prevented DHCPv6 from working, for example.
  - TX packets generated by lwIP and passed to DSWiFi weren't handled correctly
    if they were in a fragmented `pbuf`. This has been fixed.
  - Fix implementations of `ioctl()` and `fcntl()`, as well as the defines
    `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, `O_RDWR` and `O_NONBLOCK`.

- SDK:

  - Added a new package with libcurl named `blocksds-libcurl`.
  - Added a new example of how to use libcurl with BlocksDS.
  - Improve documentation of exception handler example.
  - Add a bloom example based on the original demo by Bluescrn.
  - Mention the multiple ARM7 cores in the migration guide.
  - Support edge-triggered rumble cartridges in the Slot-2 example.

## Version 1.15.2 (2025-10-14)

- libnds:

  - Fix mounting filesystems in SD cards with multiple partitions. This affected
    DeSmuME, for example. @edo9300

- DSWiFi:

  - A potential buffer overflow has been fixed in the DSi RX/TX queues.
  - The DS RX/TX queues that transfer packets between the ARM9 and ARM7 have
    been rewritten to behave like in DSi mode. Now packets are written to the
    circular buffer one after the other, but they are never cut into two parts
    when the end of the buffer is reached. This guarantees that packets are
    always stored in one piece, which means that the ARM9 can avoid doing an
    extra copy to concatenate both parts, making communications faster.
  - In DS mode packets are now read from/written to MAC RAM using DMA for extra
    speed and simplify the code.
  - Now that packets are always stored in one piece, it isn't needed to use
    `Wifi_RxRawReadPacketPointer()` to copy them to a user-allocated buffer.
    Function `Wifi_RxRawReadPacketPointer()` has been implemented as an
    alternative. It returns an uncached pointer to the packet in RAM. Please,
    check the documentation for advice on how to use them.
  - Improve random number generation. Previously, in DS mode, `W_RANDOM` was
    used for WEP seeds, a bad handmade RNG was used for WPA2 handshakes, and
    `rand()` was used in Mbed TLS instead of hardware entropy collection. A new
    system has replaced all of them. It constantly collects randomness from
    different events and updates a seed that is used to seed a xorshift32
    generator.  It isn't super secure because there is no real source of
    randomness on the DS, but it's better than the previous systems.
  - The `Wifi_TxHeader` and `Wifi_RxHeader` structs are now private. They are
    never required by user code, and there is no equivalent in DSi mode, so it's
    better to hide them.

- SDK:

  - Fix linker warning about the implementation of `__sync_synchronize`. Thanks
    to @asiekierka for the workaround.
  - In a DSWiFi example some missing instructions have been added to the console
    output.
  - The SSL DSWiFi example has been updated with more test websites.

## Version 1.15.1 (2025-10-09)

- DSWiFi:

  - In the ARM7, Mbed TLS has been moved to twl sections. This code is only
    required to connect to WPA2 networks.
  - Transfer of data between DSWiFi and lwIP in the ARM9 has been fixed. The way
    `pbuf` structs were managed was incorrect, and caused frequent assertion
    panic screens.
  - Some missing defines have been added to public DSWiFI headers.
  - Some settings have been changed in lwIP (for example, to increase the number
    of available simultaneous sockets).

## Version 1.15.0 (2025-10-07)

- libnds:

  - Fix reading console ID with `SCFG_ROM` registers disabled. @edo9300
  - Ensure crypto has been initialized when a NAND read/write command is
    received in the ARM7. @edo9300
  - Support using `write()` to send text to the console with file descriptors
    `STDOUT_FILENO` and `STDERR_FILENO`.
  - Fix potential cache corruption caused by `DC_InvalidateRange()` in
    `readFirmware()`. It has been replaced by `DC_FlushRange()`, and all calls
    to `DC_InvalidateRange()` have been removed. For more details, check Cearn's
    articles [here](https://www.coranac.com/2009/05/dma-vs-arm9-fight/) and
    [here](https://www.coranac.com/2010/03/dma-vs-arm9-round-2).
  - Add some missing SCFG and NDMA register definitions.
  - Add no$gba debug register definitions (also used in melonDS).
  - Simplify no$gba message print on the ARM9 (melonDS doesn't support the
    simplified system on the ARM7).

- DSWiFi:

  - Add new DSi mode driver with support for Open, WEP and WPA2 networks.
    @ShinyQuagsire23 is the original author of the driver. It has been
    extracted from [dsiwifi](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/dsiwifi) and
    modified to integrate it with the previous DSWiFi code.
  - This driver can be enabled by passing `WIFI_ATTEMPT_DSI_MODE` as one of the
    flags to `Wifi_InitDefault()`. It's also possible to use `WIFI_DS_MODE_ONLY`
    to force DS mode even on DSi consoles (this is the default setting).
  - The new DSi driver doesn't support NiFi mode, it's only available in
    backwards-compatible DS mode.
  - The library now reads all Access Points configured in the WFC settings of
    DSi consoles. It uses them even in backwards-compatible DS mode (but it
    ignores access points that use WPA).
  - `Wifi_ConnectAP()` has been deprecated, `Wifi_ConnectSecureAP()` supersedes
    it. It's more convenient because it takes as input a key and key length
    instead of a key and hardware definitions. It supports WPA, WEP and open
    networks.
  - The code on the ARM7 side is now divided into two parts. One of them is for
    DS mode, which is always loaded. The other one is for the DSi driver, which
    is only loaded to RAM in DSi mode. Some code can be shared between both
    modes, but not much.
  - The code has been refactored a lot. The `WIFI_MODE`, `WIFI_AUTHLEVEL` and
    `WIFI_CONNECT_STATE` state machines are now decoupled and they can't
    directly change the state of other state machines, making it easier to
    understand the execution flow.
  - The internal IPC code of the library has been simplified. Several status
    flags have been removed as they are no longer needed.
  - `Wifi_FindMatchingAP()` has been simplified. It now only checks the BSSID
    and SSID of the reference AP we're looking for.
  - Some new fields related to the security of the AP have been added to struct
    `Wifi_AccessPoint`. Also, field `rssi` is now signed instead of unsigned.
  - Mbed TLS 3.4.6 has been added to the repository. This is required by the
    WPA2 handshake code. The license has been added to the repository, and the
    SDK documentation has been update to mention the new requirements.
  - Flag `WFLAG_APDATA_ADHOC` no longer works as ad hoc mode support has been
    removed (this is different from multiplayer mode, that's still supported).
    Field `macaddr` has been removed from struct `Wifi_AccessPoint`.
  - Unused define `WFLAG_APDATA_SHORTPREAMBLE` has been removed.
  - The strings of `ASSOCSTATUS_STRINGS` have been modified to make them useful.
  - The network interface (netif) used by lwIP is now set down when the WiFi
    connection is lost and set up when the console connects to an access point.
    This helps lwIP do some things better, like DHCP.
  - Scan mode is now a bit faster in DS mode, the library stays for a shorter
    period of time in each channel.
  - A few definitions and structs have been added to the public headers, as well
    as `freeaddrinfo()` and `getaddrinfo()`.

- SDK:

  - Improve SDK version string generation. The makefiles of all tools (except
    for `dldipatch`) have been modified to use the value of `VERSION_STRING`
    provided by the user. If the string is not provided, it tries to generate a
    version string in 2 different ways. If that fails, it defaults to "DEV".
  - Added a prototype Mbed TLS 3.6.4 package to the pacman repository. Note that
    the entropy generation isn't correct, so don't use this for any application
    that requires security for now!
  - All tools (except for `dldipatch`) now accept a `-V` flag. When the tools
    are run with `-V` they print the version string and exit right away. This
    flag has been selected because some tools were already using `-v` for other
    purposes (like verbose output).
  - The file `$BLOCKSDS/version.txt` will now contain the value of
    `VERSION_STRING` generated when building BlocksDS instead of the commit ID.
  - Update license information about DSWiFi.
  - To reduce the size of NDS ROMs the default ARM9-only Makefile now uses the
    default ARM7 core with maxmod but without DSWiFi. Programs that require
    DSWiFi need to select the right core by adding this line to the Makefile:
    `ARM7ELF := $(BLOCKSDS)/sys/arm7/main_core/arm7_dswifi_maxmod.elf`
  - Examples:

    - New example that lets you display the photos stored in the NAND of a DSi
      console. @edo9300
    - The DSWiFi examples have been updated to use DSi mode and connect to WPA2
      networks whenever possible.
    - There's a new example to show how to use the new version check helpers.

## Version 1.14.2 (2025-09-17)

- libnds:

  - Improve error checking in `nitroFSInit()` when using official card commands
    to access NitroFS. `nitroFSInit()` now reads the new magic string stored by
    ndstool in the NDS ROM to check that the cartridge data can be read. The
    previous system was incorrect because the ROM header can't be read after the
    initial load of the ROM.
  - Prevent changing the filesystem label of DSi NAND partitions with
    `fatSetVolumeLabel()`. @edo9300
  - Add support for the photo partition of the DSi NAND. @edo9300
  - Save some RAM related to FatFs structs by moving them to TWL RAM. @edo9300
  - Some minor code cleanup.

- DSWiFi:

  - Implemented `inet_aton()`, `inet_addr()`, `inet_ntop()` and `inet_pton()`.
  - DSWiFi now prevents lwIP from updating its state before being connected to
    an access point.
  - Some minor code cleanup.

- ndstool:

  - Add a magic string after the FAT filesystem table. This string can be used
    by libnds to check that card commands can read the cartridge data correctly.
  - The unit code and title ID of the DSi ROM header can now be set by the user
    independently.
  - The default title ID for DSi ROMs is now the DSiware code rather than the
    DSi gamecard code. This is a compatibility break with older versions. To get
    the same result as previous invocations of ndstool you need to use the
    argument `-u 00030000`. If you were using a different title ID already now
    you will need to specify the unit code. For example, `-u 00030004` now
    becomes `-u 00030004 -uc 3`, and you can skip the `-u 00030004` because
    that's the new default value.

- SDK:

  - NitroFS now works when ROMs are loaded from Unlaunch (with some limitations,
    paths can only be up to 0x40 characters long, and file/folder names are in
    8.3 name format). Thanks to @edo9300 for his device list support additions
    and his suggestions for ndstool.
  - The example that accessess all filesystems has been improved to check the
    `nand2` filesystem as well.

## Version 1.14.1 (2025-09-10)

- libnds:

  - NitroFS now detects failures during initialization. `nitroFSInit()` has been
    cleaned and documented. Normally, `nitroFSInit()` tries to open the NDS ROM
    as a file, then it tries to read NitroFS from Slot-2 cartridge memory, and
    then it falls back to cartridge commands. There were no checks to verify
    that cartridge commands worked.
  - The exit-to-loader system has been slightly modified to increase
    compatibility with loaders that don't determine the size of DSi RAM
    correctly. The compatibility break happened in Version 0.13.0.
  - `keysCurrent()` has been marked as deprecated. `keyboardUpdate()` has been
    modified to use `keysHeld()` instead. This isn't a new break, this just adds
    a warning for users of BlocksDS. The break happened in Version 0.13.0.
  - Function `dlopen_FILE()` has been introduced. It works like `dlopen()`, but
    it takes a `FILE` handle as input instead of a path. This is useful to load
    dynamic libraries that are already in RAM instead of in the filesystem.
  - The check that verifies that the IPC transfer region fits in memory has been
    fixed to not overlap the following memory regions.
  - Card functions now use the right `CARD_` defines. @lifehackerhansol

- DSWiFi:

  - Some minor improvements to the intergration with lwIP.
  - Enable and fix some compiler warnings.

- LibXM7:

  - Enable and fix some compiler warnings.

- grit:

  - Fix `dib_pixel_replace()` for 32-bit values.
  - Added some missing `break` statements.
  - Enable and fix some compiler warnings.

- mmutil:

  - Enable and fix some compiler warnings.

- SDK:

  - Document more of the behaviour of the exit-to-loader process of the NDS
    Homebrew Menu and the bootstub struct.
  - Enable and fix some compiler warnings in dsltool, teaktool and mkfatimg.

## Version 1.14.0 (2025-09-06)

- libnds:

  - Added a new driver to read the NAND filesystem using standard filesystem
    functions (like `fopen()` and `fread()`). The NAND filesystem is normally mounted in
    read-only mode, but developers can enable writing to it if required. This is
    done so that the contents of NAND are protected by default. @edo9300
  - Fix regression causing `keysDownRepeat()` not report keys on their first
    press. @edo9300
  - Improve accuracy of `dotf32()` and `crossf32()`. In ARM mode their
    performance has increased. `crossf32()` is now always built as ARM.
    @Kuratius
  - Fix a bug that caused `rmdir()` to be unable to remove empty directories
    (because they still contained entries `"."` and `".."`). Thanks to @edo9300
    for the report and @asiekierka for the fix.
  - Added `fatGetVolumeLabel()` and `fatSetVolumeLabel()`. @asiekierka
  - Added `SDMMC_getCidRaw()`. @edo9300
  - Add basic counting semaphore helpers for the cothread module.
  - Implement `cothread_yield_signal()` and `cothread_send_signal()` to allow
    threads to sleep until a user-defined event is sent to the scheduler. If all
    threads are waiting for signals or interrupts the CPU will enter low-power
    mode.
  - Mutexes and semaphores now use signals to yield and to notify other threads
    of changes to their state.
  - Add a function to create an `argv` struct if the program is running on DSi,
    the loader hasn't provided a valid `argv` struct, but there is a valid
    device list. @edo9300
  - Replaced old FIFO IRQ defines by the new ones.
  - Some warnings have been fixed.

- DSWiFi:

  - Migrate from sgIP to lwIP. lwIP is being maintained, and it is used by lots
    of other projects, which means it has been tested properly. It also supports
    more features than sgIP.
  - This migration makes the size of NDS ROMs increse, so the build system of
    DSWiFi now creates new releases of the library without lwIP. They are useful
    for developers that only want to use the local multiplayer (NiFi) features
    of DSWiFi. The new library archives are called `libdswifi9_noip.a` and
    `libdswifi9d_noip.a`.
  - One big difference is that programs using DSWiFi will need to use
    threads. Instead of using `swiWaitForVBlank()` they will need to use
    `cothread_yield_irq(IRQ_VBLANK)`, for example. If they have a loop where
    they call `recv()` they will also need to call `cothread_yield()` at
    some point in the loop.
  - Functions `write()`, `read()` and `close()` now work with socket file
    descriptors.
  - Functions `readv()`, `writev()`, `recvmsg()` and `sendmsg()` have been
    implemented.
  - Some warnings have been fixed on ARM9 code.

- Maxmod:

  - `mmPlayModule()` has been deprecated because its name is misleading and it
    expects you to pass the address of the MAS file with an offset. The new
    function `mmPlayMAS()` replaces it. It doesn't require the offset, and it
    has a name more descriptive. `mmPlayMAS()` is also available in the ARM9,
    not just the ARM7.
  - Fix mode C mixer. Sounds didn't end until they were stopped manually, not
    when they reached the end of their sample.
  - Some small optimizations. @GValiente
  - Document some parts of the code.

- mmutil:

  - Make the output less verbose by default.
  - In module files, if a pattern uses an invalid instrument (with a sample of
    length zero), the instrument is now removed from the pattern before being
    exported. This prevents crashes on GBA when playing songs with invalid
    instruments. A warning is printed for each instance of invalid instruments
    being used.
  - In module files with instrument note maps (supported by IT and XM) mmutil
    now checks that the samples used in all note map entries are valid. If not,
    a warning is printed and it is set to 0. The warning is only printed once
    per sample per instrument.
  - Prevent mmutil from exporting more than 200 pattern orders for modules. The
    MAS format is hardcoded to 200 pattern orders, so any module that has more
    entries than that will be clamped and mmutil will print a warning.

- SDK:

  - In the crt0 of the ARM9, generate an `argv` struct if the application is
    running on a DSi, there is no valid `argv` provided by the loader, but there
    is a valid device list. @edo9300
  - Add example of how to play MAS files with Maxmod manually without a
    soundbank.
  - Improve example `nitrofs_and_fat` to also display the contents of the NAND
    filesystem. It has been renamed to `all_filesystems`.
  - Update DSWiFi examples to work with the new version of DSWiFi.
  - Add example of how to wait for signals in multithreading applications.
  - Add test of setting and getting filesystem labels.
  - Allow building all examples and tests in parallel. @steveschnepp

## Version 1.13.1 (2025-08-20)

- libnds:

  - The detection of the official Slot-2 rumble pak (NTR-008) has been fixed. It
    used to be detected as a SuperCard. Also, the rumble API of libnds is now
    more flexible when detecting the type of activation of rumble. @asiekierka
  - The enum of IPC commands used by DSWiFi has been moved from libnds to DSWiFi
    and made private.
  - The system monitor of DS debugger units is now preserved during the startup
    process of libnds. The last 512KB of RAM are reserved so that the heap can't
    grow too much and overwrite them (they can be used again if the developer
    manually calls `reduceHeapSize(0)`). Additionally, libnds won't setup an
    exception handler if it detects a debugger unit. The developer has to do it
    manually by calling `defaultExceptionHandler()`. Thanks @Gericom for the bug
    report.

- Maxmod:

  - Fix instruments with panning and pitch envelope enabled at the same time.
    Previously, the panning envelope was used for the pitch envelope by mistake.
  - On GBA now `mmInit()` and `mmInitDefault()` return error if the number of
    requested channels is bigger than 32. This wasn't supported anyway, and it
    would have silently failed if allowed.
  - The memory used by the panning slide VCMD on XM modules was using the volume
    slide memory when panning to the right (it used the right memory when
    panning to the left).
  - The memory entries used by effects and volume effects has been documented.
  - The IPC command for the ARM9 `mmReverbConfigure()` function has been
    simplified. It will now send all parameters in all cases, but this is what
    users will be using in most cases. In exchange for this, the function
    becomes a lot smaller and easier to maintain.
  - Check a few TODO notes and fix them (or remove them if they didn't need any
    work).
  - In the GBA port, move a function outside of IWRAM. This brings down IWRAM
    usage to a size lower than the ASM version of Maxmod, and it doesn't affect
    performance in a noticeable way. @aronson
  - Remove `always_inline` attribute from some functions to fix a build error
    with clang. @GalaxyShard
  - In DS mode, using Maxmod commands before initializing it will now show a
    crash error. This is more informative than simply ignoring commands.
  - A critical bug has been fixed on the ARM7. In some cases, it was possible
    for the ARM7 message handler to be interrupted while editing the state
    of the circular buffer. This would leave the buffer in an inconsistent state
    and make the ARM7 treat uninitialized values in memory as legitimate ARM9
    commands, causing crashes. Thanks to @pyramidensurfer for a test that
    managed to reproduce the error reliably.
  - The ARM7 communications code is now built as Thumb instead of ARM to save
    space.
  - The GBA version of Maxmod is now built with a format of debug symbols that
    no$gba can understand.

- DSWiFi:

  - The enum of IPC commands used by DSWiFi has been moved from libnds to DSWiFi
    and made private. Some commands weren't used and they have been removed.
  - `Wifi_InitDefault()` now takes an int as argument instead of a bool. This
    lets the function get more flags in the future if they are implemented. Old
    C code using true or false will still work.
  - Lots of functions have been made private: Everything that has to do with
    manual initialization and synchronization between CPUs. Making this code
    private gives DSWiFi more flexibility to refactor the code.
  - The initialization code of the library has been cleaned up and simplified.
  - It is now possible to deinitialize DSWiFi with `Wifi_Deinit()`. This will
    keep the sgIP memory pool still in the heap, but it will free all other
    resources. sgIP can't be reinitialized safely at the moment.
  - `Wifi_InitDefault()` now accepts flags `WIFI_DISABLE_LED` and
    `WIFI_ENABLE_LED` to let DSWiFi know if it can control the LED blinking or
    not. By default, the LED is controlled by DSWiFi.
  - `Wifi_InitDefault()` now accepts flags `WIFI_INTERNET_AND_LOCAL` and
    `WIFI_LOCAL_ONLY`. It makes it possible to initialize DSWiFi without sgIP if
    the game isn't going to connect to the Internet. This saves over a 100 KBs
    of RAM in games that only want to setup a local multiplayer game. DSWiFi can
    be de-initialized and re-initialized in "local only" or "internet and local"
    modes whenver your application requires it. The documentation has been
    updated to reflect the new improvements.
  - Some static arrays used by sgIP are now allocated dynamically when the
    library is initialized. They are also freed when it is de-initialized.

- mmutil:

  - Change version number. Now it's set from the environment instead of a
    hardcoded variable in the Makefile.
  - Fix pattern flags when notes have non-empty volume. This bug was introduced
    in version 1.12.0. Thanks @GValiente for the bug report and @asiekierka for
    the help.

- SDK:

  - The local multiplayer example of DSWiFi now initializes DSWiFi without sgIP
    so to save RAM.
  - Use C23 and C++23 to build all the ARM libraries.
  - GCC has been patched to always build `__aeabi_lmul` in ARM mode, even for
    Thumb targets. This always leads to smaller and faster 64-bit multiply
    operations. @asiekierka
  - picolibc has been updated with minor fixes to the `printf` function family.

## Version 1.13.0 (2025-08-11)

- libnds:

  - A new function to control the LCD backlight level has been implemented,
    `systemSetBacklightLevel()`. It works on DS, DS Lite and DSi.
  - Add a helper to set the master sound volume from the ARM9 called
    `soundSetMasterVolume()`.
  - videoGL functions now copy textures and palettes to VRAM using `memcpy()`
    instead of DMA copies. This will allow interrupts to happen while the copy
    is taking place instead of blocking the interrupts.
  - FatFs has been updated to R0.16. Also, `stat()` now returns the actual
    creation timestamp of the file instead of using the time of the last access
    or modification. @asiekierka
  - libnds now checks that TLS isn't used from IRQ handlers. This is only
    checked in debug builds of libnds because it would affect performance of
    some applications.
  - Add support for compile-time evaluation of the `math.h` functions. @Kuratius
  - `errno` handling has been fixed in `scandir()`. @shinyquagsire23
  - Fix memory leak in `open()` when a file is failed to be opened.
    @shinyquagsire23
  - Return 0 as modification and access dates of NitroFS files instead of
    leaving the fields uninitialized.
  - Don't clear `errno` in `readdir()`. @asiekierka
  - Add new ARM7 audio defines that are less confusing than the previous ones.
    They are based on the names used by GBATEK. The audio helpers of libnds now
    use the new defines.
  - The FatFs submodule link has been changed. If you want to update your
    current clone of BlocksDS you will need to manually edit
    `.git/modules/libs/libnds/modules/fatfs/config` and change the URL to
    "blocksds" instead of "WonderfulToolchain". You can also do a fresh clone.
  - Some Doxygen comments with missing information have been completed.
  - The internal function `vramGetBank()` has been improved with error checking.
  - Some videoGL code has been documented.

- Maxmod

  - The port to C has been completed. The only code left in assembly is the one
    that does software audio mixing on the GBA and the ARM7 of the DS. All of
    the definitions to access structures from assembly code have been deleted
    (except for the ones needed for the software mixing code).
  - Some functions now return error codes instead of `void`: `mmInit()`,
    `mmInitDefault()`, `mmInitDefaultMem()`, `mmLoad()`, `mmUnload()`,
    `mmLoadEffect()` and `mmUnloadEffect()`.
  - In the GBA port Maxmod can now be deinitialized with `mmEnd()`. This isn't
    possible on DS yet.
  - Helpers `mmGetModuleCount()` and `mmGetSampleCount()` have been added to get
    the number of modules and samples available in the loaded sound bank. They
    are available from both CPUs. Previously, it was only possible on the ARM9,
    and only by accessing internal variables of Maxmod.
  - The following functions now check if the provided ID is out of bounds:
    `mmEffect()`, `mmEffectEx()`, `mmStart()`, `mmJingle()`, `mmLoad()`,
    `mmUnload()`, `mmLoadEffect()` and `mmUnloadEffect()`.
  - All arrays have been marked as `const`. Some functions have been moved back
    from IWRAM to ROM. This has no effect in the DS port, but it helps the GBA
    port reduce IWRAM usage.
  - Several comments have been added to the code.
  - The code now uses the struct definitions of the headers instead of using
    magic numbers and assembly defines. Several variables have been modified to
    use the right types (for example, instead of using a `void` pointer, they
    use now pointers to the right type of struct).
  - A small bug when handling module channel bflags has been fixed.
  - Fix the way in which the code that handles DCT accesses the instrument note
    map. This is a bug carried on from the assembly code.
  - `mmSetPosition()` is now available on the DS, not just the GBA.
  - `mmJingleStart()` and `mmJingleStop()` have been implemented. They behave
    like `mmStart()` and `mmStop()`, so now jingles can also be played in a loop
    and they can be stopped at any point.
  - `mmJinglePause()` and `mmJingleResume()` have been implemented.
  - `mmJingleActive()` has been implemented.
  - `mmPosition()`, `mmJingle()` and `mmActiveSub()` have been deprecated. Use
    `mmSetPosition()`, `mmJingleStart()` and `mmJingleActive()` instead.
  - `mmGetPosition()` and `mmGetPositionRow()` have been implemented on the
    ARM9. The ARM7 refreshes the position once per frame, so the tick counter
    can easily skip values from the point of view of the ARM9. For that reason,
    `mmGetPositionTick()` hasn't been implemented.
  - Sound effect handling has been heavily refactored. The ARM7 code that
    creates and reuses handles is now cleaner. The code that synchronizes the
    state of the sound effects from the ARM7 to the ARM9 has been removed. Now,
    the ARM9 sends messages to the ARM7 and it waits for the ARM7 to send the
    resulting handle to the ARM9. The previous system generated handles on the
    ARM9, which could cause channels to become permanently marked as "busy" on
    the ARM9 even if they were free on the ARM7.
  - `mmEffectCancel()` and `mmEffectCancelAll()` now work properly on DS.
  - `mmEffectCancelAll()` can now stop released sound effects.
  - `mmEffectRelease()` now has a big warning in the documentation mentioning
    that any effect that has been released can only be stopped by itself, by
    another effect or module, or by `mmEffectCancelAll()`. It can't be stopped
    by `mmEffectCancel()`.
  - A bug has been fixed where there could be memory corruption if a new active
    channel was requested but no more channels were available.
  - In the documentation, create individual section for functions related to
    jingles. Keeping them in a different page than the functions for the main
    module means it's easier to see the limitations of jingles.
  - Events of type `MMCB_SONGMESSAGE` now include the layer (`MM_MAIN` or
    `MM_JINGLE`) as part of the data passed to the callback. This is a
    compatibility break, but it's very unlikely that anyone is getting events
    from a jingle, so it's very unlikely to break any project. Events are rarely
    used, so the probability of ever finding a compatibility issue is almost 0.
  - Fix a crash that would happen when playing modules or jingles with more
    channels than allocated by Maxmod. Now, when Maxmod detects that the module
    (or jingle) tries to use a channel that is outside of the limits, it will
    just stop the song.
  - `mmSetPatternEx()` has been implemented, which lets the caller specify the
    new pattern order and row, not just the order like with `mmSetPattern()`.
  - Build library with `-Os` instead of `-O2` in the ARM7 of the NDS to save
    memory.

- mmutil:

  - Some error checks have been added to prevent crashes if files can't be
    opened or an output path isn't provided. The application will now exit
    gracefully.
  - Some magic numbers have been replaced by defines extracted from Maxmod. The
    code has been documented a bit.
  - Some warnings have been fixed.
  - The code has been reorganized. Variables now have reduced scopes instead of
    having whole functions as their scope.
  - The command to build NDS test ROMs has been fixed in the documentation.
  - The names of the temporary files created by the tool is no longer hardcoded.
    This makes it possible to execute mmutil multiple times from the same folder
    without conflicts.

- DSWifi:

  - Update instructions of how to enable debug output.
  - Build library with `-Os` instead of `-O2` to save memory.

- LibXM7:

  - Use new libnds ARM7 audio defines.

- SDK:

  - GCC has been updated to version 15.2.0 and binutils has been updated to
    version 2.45. @asiekierka
  - The default makefiles now print the mmutil command in verbose mode (`V=`).
  - The documentation now has a note about symlinks not working with MinGW.
  - Some Maxmod examples have been improved.
  - An example has been added to show how to set the LCD brightness level on
    different DS models.

## Version 1.12.0 (2025-07-12)

- libnds:

  - Rename symbols of FatFs inside libnds so that users can have their own copy
    of FatFs. @asiekierka
  - Improve `normalizef32()`: Fix normalization of large and small vectors and
    optimize its performance. @Kuratius, @19tracks
  - Fix base address of the bootstub struct.
  - Clarify documentation about how `keysDownRepeat()` works.
  - Move some key state handling to critical sections to prevent race
    conditions.
  - Fix implementation of `swiIntrWait()` on both CPUs. It has been rewritten in
    C and moved to the common folder so that both CPUs use the same
    implementation.
  - Two defines have been added for `swiIntrWait()`: `INTRWAIT_KEEP_FLAGS` and
    `INTRWAIT_CLEAR_FLAGS`.
  - Improve FIFO communications code:

    - In FIFO wait loops, don't discard current interrupts flags when calling
      `swiIntrWait()`. If a FIFO interrupt has happened, exit the wait loop
      right away.
    - In `fifoWait*()`, check `REG_IME` before calling `swiIntrWait()`. If
      interrupts are disabled, skip the wait. `swiIntrWait()` enables interrupts
      internally, and this may be an issue for code that relies on interrupts
      being disabled. The only side-effect of not calling `swiIntrWait()` is
      that the CPU won't be able to enter low-power mode.
    - Fix some race conditions by moving some code and checks to critical
      sections.
    - Add some new definitions related to FIFO interrupts that are clearer than
      the previous ones.
    - Prevent deadlocks in some situations. For example, if the software RX
      queue was almost full, the hardware RX queue is half emptied in the IRQ
      handler, but it can't be completely emptied, the FIFO code would never
      check the hardware RX queue again. There were similar situations with the
      TX queue. The new code adds checks for the RX and TX hardware queues in
      some other places (like `fifoCheck*()` or `fifoInternalSend()`) that are
      likely to be executed in any potential user wait loop.
    - The FIFO buffer has been renamed to global FIFO pool. The send and receive
      queues have been renamed to RX and TX queues.
    - Fix global pool corruption when the pool got filled with packets that
      hadn't been handled. The code that allocates and frees blocks from the
      pool can't handle the situation in which zero blocks are left, so the new
      code makes sure that there is always at least one free block in the pool.
    - The code has been documented, and things like the global pool of blocks
      have been refactored to be much clearer.
    - Unknown system FIFO commands will now crash the application instead of
      being ignored.

  - Improve cothread system:

    - Show a crash message when trying to remove a nonexistent cothread context.
    - Optimize `cothread_yield_irq()`.
    - Prevent `cothread_yield()`, `cothread_yield_irq()` and
      `cothread_yield_irq_aux()` from inside  interrupt handlers. Instead of
      yielding, `cothread_yield()` returns right away, and the others call
      `swiIntrWait()` instead.
    - `swiIntrWait()` is now only called if `REG_IME=1`. If not, it is skipped.

  - Refactor global IRQ handler:

    - Remove the `irqDummy()` function, use `NULL` pointers instead.
    - Use fewer cycles to exit the handler when there isn't an user interrupt
      handler assigned to the interrupt.
    - Optimize code that wakes up threads waiting for an interrupt, preventing
      racen conditions.

  - Compile `getHeap*()` functions on the ARM7 too. @asiekierka

- Maxmod:

  - Fix Portamento + Volume Slide effect.

- Grit:

  - Crash if mode append is selected but it's not allowed due to other settings.
    In the past, grit would just overwrite the invalid setting without warning
    the user.
  - Add note to the documentation about how it is better to reduce quality of
    graphics before passing them to grit than to let grit reduce the quality.

- SDK:

  - Documentation:

    - Add a section to the "Usage notes" page about how to move the DTCM user
      variables to the end of DTCM using the `__dtcm_data_size` symbol.

  - Examples:

    - Fix example of streaming audio with Maxmod. Instead of reading the file
      from the Maxmod callback handler (which is inside an interrupt handler)
      the example now keeps a circular buffer. The main loop writes new data
      read from the file and the interrupt handler reads the data and sends it
      to Maxmod.
    - Add example of displaying a 4 BPP tiled background. Rename the previous
      `bg_regular` example to `bg_regular_8bit` to clarify that it loads a 8 BPP
      tiled background.
    - Add example of creating an FPS counter.
    - Add example of how to use the VBL interrupt.
    - Improve C++ example to also run on the ARM7.
    - Add example of how to use DMA to do HBLANK scroll effects.
    - Add example of how to save and load data from the filesystem.
    - Improve `key_input` example to show the values returned by
      `keysDownRepeat()`.
    - Fix build of the example that prints no$gba debug messages from both CPUs.
      Floating point support has been removed from `printf()` on the ARM7 to
      save space.

  - Tests:

    - The exit to loader test has been fixed (even though the exit code doesn't
      work properly yet).
    - Add a test to see how to exit CPU halt state with IRQs.
    - Add a test to see the effect of deleting threads in different ways.
    - Add a test to check that CPU contexts are preserved after returning from a
      cothread yield.
    - Add a test to check the behaviour of the FIFO handling code when the FIFO
      hardware and software queues are full.
    - Some test folders have been moved around for clarity.
    - Add test of using the `__dtcm_data_size` symbol.

  - Other:

    - Modify the default makefiles to allow the user to specify additional
      `LDFLAGS` when including them.

## Version 1.11.1 (2025-05-30)

- libnds:

  - Fix a bug that would crash the application if `__aeabi_atexit()` was called
    when a dynamic library isn't being loaded.

- SDK:

  - Fix linker scripts to include the picolibc hook that calls all functions
    registered with the `atexit()` family of functions. This also affected
    global destructors, which weren't called at exit. @asiekierka
  - Improve C++ example to test global destructors in addition to global
    constructors.

## Version 1.11.0 (2025-05-29)

- libnds:

  - Improve performance of camera driver significantly.
  - Support using TLS symbols from the main binary in dynamic libraries.
  - Support `R_ARM_JUMP24` relocation in dynamic libraries, which tends to be
    used for tail function calls in ARM mode.
  - Support global constructors and destructors in dynamic libraries. They are
    called when libraries are loaded and unloaded.
  - Add `dlmembase()` function to get the base address of a loaded dynamic
    library, which can be used to load the ELF file at the right address when
    debugging the program with GDB.
  - Add defines to manually place variables in ITCM.
  - The two variables placed in DTCM by the cothreads code have been moved to
    ITCM to help the stack grow (they were being placed at the start of DTCM,
    which stopped the stack from growing into main RAM).
  - Fix `grfLoadMemEx()` and `grfLoadFileEx()` when passing `NULL` in `header`.
  - A few improvements to `hw_sqrtf()`. @Kuratius
  - Minor documentation fixes. @Kuratius
  - Reintroduce list of copyright holders to the license file. @asiekierka
  - Uniformize license headers and update the list of copyright holders in the
    license file.

- Maxmod:

  - Fix some size definitions in the GBA public headers.
  - Fix memory leaks when unloading modules. @ds-sloth
  - A lot of assembly code has been converted to C, particularly code related to
    the module player and effects handling.
  - Fix bug when stopping the playback of a module. This caused noise to be
    generated in the GBA port when a song was stopped.
  - The DS programming guide has been fixed.

- mmutil:

  - Add readme to repository.

- SDK:

  - dsltool:

    - Support using TLS symbols from the main binary in dynamic libraries.
    - Support `R_ARM_JUMP24` relocations.
    - Support loading ELF files with more than 256 symbols. @jonko0493
    - Add link to documentation about relocations.
    - Support global constructors and destructors.
    - Provide `__dso_handle` in all dynamic libraries.

  - Examples:

    - Add C constructor to basic dynamic library example and improve it in
      general.
    - Add example of using C++ dynamic libraries.
    - Let user stop song in audio modes Maxmod example.

  - Other:

    - Document limitations of dynamic libraries and how to debug them.
    - Enable default exception handler in the default debug ARM7 cores.
    - Clarify hack used in the crt0 to reference some symbols and prevent the
      garbage collector of the linker from removing it.


## Version 1.10.1 (2025-04-26)

- SDK:

  - Other:

    - Global initializers have been fixed for picolibc 1.8.10.
    - Fix conflicting types when including `math.h` instead of `cmath` from C++
      files.

## Version 1.10.0 (2025-04-25)

- Maxmod:

  - Most of the files of the library have been converted from assembly to C to
    help people understand, maintain and improve the code. The remaining
    assembly code is the software mixing code of the ARM7 (on both DS and GBA
    modes) and the song player code (which is too big to convert in one go and
    it will require more work in the future). Both the GBA and DS ports have
    been tested. Thanks to @Lorenzooone for all his work!
  - Some error checks have been added to code that didn't have it (like all code
    using `fopen()`, `fread()` or `malloc()`.
  - Code that allocates memory now uses `calloc()` instead of `malloc()` to
    clear the buffer before using it.
  - The unused Value32 FIFO handler code in the ARM7 has been removed.
  - Cache management has been fixed. The cache handling functions of Maxmod were
    incorrect, and they have been removed. Now Maxmod uses the functions of
    libnds.
  - IPC code that synchronized streaming between ARM7 and ARM9 has been
    improved. Instead of using shared memory to synchronize CPUs, new FIFO
    messages have been implemented. The old code required dangerous cache
    management that could corrupt variables surounding the "ready" flag used by
    the library.

- SDK:

  - Other:

    - GCC has been updated to version 15.1.0 in Wonderful Toolchain. You can
      check the release notes [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-15/changes.html).
      An important addition is the support for `#embed`.
    - picolibc has been updated to version 1.8.10 in Wonderful Toolchain. Check
      the release notes [here](https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc/releases/tag/1.8.10).

  - Examples:

    - A new example of how to use sound effects with Maxmod has been added.
    - The Maxmod streaming example has been fixed to not hang in DSi consoles or
      DS consoles with DLDI running on the ARM7.
    - The reverb Maxmod example has bee improved with a new song that makes the
      effect more evident.
    - The "sprites" example has been renamed to "sprites_regular" for clarity.
      Also, 128 KB sprite mapping mode is now used in this example, as this is
      what most developers would want in their own code.
    - Some comments have been added to the libnds sound example.
    - A missing example description has been added.

## Version 1.9.1 (2025-04-03)

- libnds:

  - A new function has been added to reduce the heap space from the end of RAM:
    `reduceHeapSize()`.
  - The sprite mapping enums have been simplified by removing a part of the
    value that wasn't used by anything.
  - A few documentation improvements in backgrounds, sprites and FIFO
    definitions.

- SDK:

  - Documentation:

    - The memory map documentation has been updated.

  - Examples:

    - The images used in 2D sprites and backgrounds examples have been improved.
    - A new example has been added to show how to use main engine video mode 6.
    - A new example has been added to show how to use extended affine
      backgrounds. There was only an example of how to use regular affine
      backgrounds.
    - The example of sprites that use extended palettes has been updated to use
      multiple palettes per engine instead of just one.

  - Tests:

    - A new test has been added to check the bounds of the heap compared to the
      bounds of DTCM. It also checks if `reduceHeapSize()`, `malloc()` and
      `free()` interact the right way.

  - crts:

    - A very old bug has been fixed where the heap end in DSi mode would allow
      malloc() to allocate memory inside DTCM (which is used by the stack, and
      would corrupt it). Thanks to @ds-sloth for the initial report that
      resulted in finding the bug.

  - Other:

    - A new tutorial for BlocksDS has been started. It's available
      [here](https://blocksds.skylyrac.net/tutorial/), and the source code is
      available [here](https://github.com/blocksds/tutorial).

## Version 1.9.0 (2025-03-26)

- libnds:

  - Add initial helpers to load dynamic libraries with `dlfcn.h` functions. Note
    that this is still experimental. `dlopen()`, `dlsym()`, `dlerror()` and
    `dlclose()` are supported.
  - Fixed global C++ constructors that require libnds and the cothread scheduler
    to be initialized. Some functions previously called from the crt0 have been
    moved to `cothread_main()`, which runs after there is a valid multithreading
    environment.
  - Deallocate memory reserved for the FAT file system cache if `fatInit()`
    fails.
  - Extend `statvfs()` to return the `ST_RDONLY` flag for read-only media.
  - File system operations should now return `EROFS` for read-only DLDI
    drivers.
  - Made `libndsCrash()` public.
  - Fix potential issues involving FAT file system cache initialization.
  - Add some checks to libc system call functions like `open()`.

- DSWifi:

  - Fix `ioctl(FIONREAD, x)`, which used to return `EINVAL` even when it
    succeeded.
  - Remove Access Points from the list of availabled APs after enough time has
    passed without receiving any beacon packet from them. `Wifi_GetData()` and
    `Wifi_GetAPData()` have been updated to work with the changed system.
  - The array that specifies the order in which channels are scanned has been
    modified so that each channel is scanned the same number of times. This
    makes it easier to determine which APs to remove from the list of APs
    because we aren't prioritizing APs from any channel. Also, scan mode now
    always start with channel 1.
  - Old RSSI values of APs are now discarded instead of being used to average
    the value of the RSSI. This doesn't really affect how the values behave in
    real life that much, so this change saves memory with no noticeable change
    in the behaviour of the library.
  - Return error on timeouts when writing to baseband chip.
  - Add error checks when initializing RF chip.
  - Print debug message if the ARM7 TX queue is full when the library tries to
    add a new packet to it.
  - Some documentation improvements.

- dsltool:

  - Introduced tool to the repository. This tool is used to convert dynamic
    libraries in ELF format to DSL format, which is similar to ELF, but
    simplified. This DSL format can be loaded by libnds with `dlopen()`.

- teaktool:

  - Ensure that ELF files are loaded correctly instead of crashing if they
    aren't loaded and the pointer is NULL.
  - Fix format in a printf.

- SDK:

  - Documentation:

    - The new dynamic library system has been documented in the main
      documentation of BlocksDS.

  - Examples:

    - Three new examples have been added to show how to use the new dynamic
      library system.

  - crts:

    - Some initialization has been moved away from the crt0 of the ARM9 to
      libnds to fix global C++ constructors that require libnds and the cothread
      scheduler to be initialized.
    - A new linkerscript to build dynamic libraries has been added.

  - Other:

    - Libraries are now built with debug symbols (`-g`) to help debug
      applications made with them.

## Version 1.8.1 (2025-03-07)

- libnds:

  - Add a helper to convert UTF-16LE text (like the firmware player name and
    message) to UTF-8.
  - Modify `assert()` on the ARM7 to send the information to the ARM9 instead of
    displaying it on the no$gba console.
  - Added `swiIntrWaitAUX()` for the ARM7.
  - The Doxygen documentation of interrupt functions has been fixed.
  - The documentation of the firmware personal data has been improved with a
    warning saying that the struct may not be initialized right af the beginning
    of `main()` on the ARM9.
  - Always use `fake_heap_start` and `fake_heap_end` in `sbrk()`.
  - Some assertions in the timer functions were missing checks for values lower
    than zero, this has been fixed.
  - All instances of `sassert()` in common ARM7 and ARM9 code have been replaced
    by `assert()`.

- DSWifi:

  - Add player name information to beacon packets, and add it to the
    `Wifi_AccessPoint` struct so that clients can see it. This name can be
    replaced by any string defined by the developer if required.
  - Add way to get the RSSI of the AP we're connected to. It can be done by
    calling `Wifi_GetData(WIFIGETDATA_RSSI)`. @Snowshoe
  - Always include `ASSOCSTATUS_STRINGS` array in builds. It used to be removed
    in builds without sgIP.
  - Some minor documentation fixes.

- grit:

  - Update documentation (command line interface and changelog).
  - Let the build system define the version string compiled in the binary.

- SDK:

  - Examples:

    - In DSWifi examples, print multiplayer access points in color red when they
      aren't accepting new connections. Also, display the player name provided
      by the beacon frames.
    - There's a new test to verify that `sbrk()` works correctly in both the
      ARM7 and ARM9.
    - Update the asserts example to show that asserts that happen in the ARM7
      are sent to the ARM9 and displayed on the screen.

  - Documentation:

    - Document flag used for "twl" sections in ndstool and the linkerscripts.

  - Other:

    - Remove duplicated `__end__` entries in ARM7 linkerscript files.
    - The fake heap pointers are now setup on the ARM7, not only the ARM9.
    - The fake heap limit setup has been documented.
    - The R4RF DLDI driver included in the SDK has been updated.
    - Update CMake build system to link the debug version of libnds in debug
      builds.

## Version 1.8.0 (2025-02-28)

- libnds:

  - videoGL now tracks the number of textures using a palettes correctly.
    Previously, palettes would be deleted even when there were textures using
    them. @sillysagiri
  - `scanf()` has been fixed so that it doesn't record modifier keys on the
    output string.
  - Fix `readFirmware()` and `writeFirmware()` on the ARM9. They would silently
    fail when the source or destination buffer wasn't in main RAM (for example,
    when the buffer was in the stack in DTCM) because the ARM7 can't access
    other memory regions. Now, the functions will allocate temporary buffers to
    transfer data between the ARM7 and ARM9. Also, now they use a mutex so that
    they are thread-safe.
  - FatFs has been updated to version R0.15ap1.
  - The values used by `ledBlink()` have been documented as an enum.
  - There's a new define for the WiFi hardware in `REG_POWERCNT`.
  - There are new definitions for GRF files to specify background types.
  - `consoleVprintf()` is now exposed on the ARM7.
  - In the GRF struct there used to be a byte of padding in the struct that
    wasn't documented. It has now been explicitly documented as padding.
  - A helper has been added to check if a buffer is inside of main RAM.
  - Some unused internal FIFO command names have been removed.

- DSWifi:

  - Local multiplayer support has been added (NiFi). One DS acts as a
    multiplayer host (Access Point) and the other consoles connect to it.
  - The old operation mode has been renamed "Internet mode". It is possible to
    switch between Internet and local multiplayer modes depending on the needs
    of the application.
  - Scan mode now works differently. In Internet mode it shows all Access
    Points. In local multiplayer mode it only lists multiplayer hosts, in
    Internet mode the behaviour remains unchanged.
  - CMD/REPLY packet transmit support has been added to the library. This is a
    way to transfer data between a host and many clients more efficiently.
    However, regular data packets can still be sent between multiplayer clients
    and the host if the CMD/REPLY system isn't adequate for the application.
  - Beacon packet transmission is now properly supported and documented. The
    packets advertise the number of players currently connected to a host DS and
    whether the host accepts new connections or not. It also shows the game ID
    defined by the user, which is used to identify the right AP for a game.
  - When connecting to an Access Point, DSWifi is now honest about the transfer
    rates supported by the DS. If the AP rejects the connection, it will retry
    with all the rates defined in the IEEE 802.11b standard (even though only
    the first 2 out of the 4 are supported), which helps the AP accept the DS.
  - Many new multiplayer-related functions have been added to the library.
  - New documentation has been added, which explains how the library works
    internally, and how to use DSWifi in Internet and local multiplayer mode.
  - Huge refactor of ARM7 code and the corresponding ARM9 code that communicates
    with the ARM7. sgIP has been largely untouched. The code has been split into
    several files, and there is now a clearer split between sgIP and the rest of
    DSWifi.
  - The helper functions to read the firmware and to set the LED blink status
    have been removed. Now DSWifi calls the libnds functions instead.
  - Functions have been documented, IEEE 802.11 frame formats have been
    documented.
  - There are new defines for hardware registers based on GBATEK, and new
    defines for the fields in the hardware registers that are in used. The
    [melonDS forums](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/board/thread.php?id=34) have a
    lot of information (by @Arisotura) that has also been used as source when
    documenting register fields (like `W_RXFILTER` and `W_RXFILTER2`).
  - Debug messages have been added to the ARM7 code of the library. They are
    only available in debug builds.
  - WEP password usage has been documented. It wasn't clear how to use Hex/ASCII
    passwords.
  - Some unused fields of the `WifiData` struct have been removed.
  - Private definitions have been removed from public headers.

- grit:

  - Update GRF export code to use the new background type definitions proposed
    by @Garhoogin in [ptexconv](https://github.com/Garhoogin/ptexconv/issues/3).

- SDK

  - Examples:

    - New DSWifi examples have been added, including local multiplayer examples
      that show how to send CMD/REPLY packets and regular data frames of
      arbitrary sizes.
    - The WEP password input in the AP list example has been improved. The
      output of the example has also been improved.
    - The "get website" example now uses socket-related functions the way DSWifi
      expects them (`closesocket()` instead of `close()`).
    - The templates and examples now use the new LED defines.

  - Documentation:

    - The documentation of DSWifi now explains how to use the Internet and local
      multiplayer modes, as well as how the library works internally.
    - The licensing requirements of some libraries (picolibc, libstdc++) has
      been clarified by @asiekierka.

  - Other:

    - New debug ARM7 cores have been added. They use the debug versions of
      libnds and DSWifi.
    - The CMake build system now uses a linker group for the standard libraries
      to prevent linking errors due to circular dependencies. Also, banner title
      formation has been improved.

## Version 1.7.3 (2025-01-15)

- libnds:

  - Use custom version of `swiSoftReset()` instead of instruction `swi #0` to
    prevent crashes on DSi mode, where `swi #0` isn't implemented.
  - `swi*()` functions that don't actually use `swi` instructions (because of
    bugs in the implementation in the BIOS) have been documented.
  - `nitroFSInit()` now sets `errno` correctly if there is no NitroFS filesystem
    in the ROM.
  - The DSi mode checks of `soundExtSetFrequencyTWL()` have been moved out of
    `twl` sections so that this function can be safely called even in DS mode
    (even if it doesn't have any effect).
  - Calling `irqSet(flags, NULL)` or `irqSetAUX(flags, NULL)` is now safe.
    Previously, this would cause `NULL` to be used as interrupt handler instead
    of disabling the interrupt handler as expected.
  - The type `IntFn` has been deprecated in favour of `VoidFn`. Even the
    `interrupts.h` header didn't use `IntFn`, it was only used internally in
    `interrupts.c`.

- SDK:

  - Docker:

    - The Docker images are now built in a GitHub Actions pipeline in the SDK
      repository instead of locally in the computers of the developers.

  - Examples:

    - In the LibXM7 example that uses NitroFS, set pointer to `NULL` when it
      stops being used so that the program keeps track of whether songs are
      playing or not. This fixes a crash when trying to start a song after
      stopping a song.

  - Documentation:

    - Document the release process for new BlocksDS versions.
    - Document the existence minimal ARM7 core.
    - Remove references to scripts related to the release process used before
      using GitHub Actions.
    - Add link to `ndslib-archive` repository so that it can be used as
      reference to understand old NDS homebrew source code.
    - Clarify how to build examples in the setup instructions.

  - Other:

    - Use the right system header in `dldipatch` to fix a compiler warning.
    - PAlib is now available as a pacman package: `blocksds-palib`

## Version 1.7.2 (2025-01-07)

- libnds:

  - Fix compilation error due to incorrect names of slot-2 rumble functions.
  - Add debug assertions to check that `cothread_yield_irq()` is never called
    with interrupts disabled (when `IME` is 0).
  - Small optimization in `cothread_yield_irq()` wait loop on the ARM9.
  - Add helper constants for `swiUnpackBits()`.
  - Implement `getBatteryLevel()` on the ARM7 to mirror the ARM9 implementation.
  - Add function to check if FatFs cache has been initialized or not.
  - Fix code to read official cartridges from the ARM7. The previous code wasn't
    able to read data when the destination was in the stack (DTCM isn't visible
    by the ARM7).
  - Add error checks on the ARM7 to crash if DLDI is used before being setup.
  - Fix undefined C behaviour with some left shifts.
  - Add missing system include to ARM7 console header.

- SDK:

  - ARM7:

    - Restructure default ARM7 code to allow for multiple built-in ARM7 cores.
      Add `ARM7ELF` to the default makefiles to easily select the ARM7 core.
      Thanks, @GalaxyShard.

  - Documentation:

    - Document the new pre-built ARM7 cores.

  - Examples:

    - Use the new pre-built ARM7 core in LibXM7 examples instead of custom ARM7
      cores.
    - Update the BIOS bit unpack example to use the new constants introduced to
      libnds.

  - Other:

    - In the makefiles of DSWiFi, LibXM7 and Maxmod use `ar` from the ARM
      toolchain rather than the host to build the library.
    - Improve scripts to release new SDK versions.

## Version 1.7.1 (2024-12-25)

- libnds:

  - Fixed a bug where some assembly functions would be removed by the linker.
    This happened when a function is supposed to fall through the following one,
    but it is in a different section. If this other section isn't referenced
    anywhere, the linker would remove it.
  - A new system to send formatted text messages from the ARM7 to the ARM9 has
    been implemented. This works by using a ring buffer in main RAM that is
    allocated from the ARM9, so the user can adjust its size easily. This is
    still being tested and it may change.

- SDK:

  - Docker:

    - Install BlocksDS from pacman packages instead of building it from source.
      This will make it easier to install other third-party packages. It won't
      be needed to build them from source and install them, you will be able to
      simply install the package. The slim image only has the
      `blocksds-toolchain` package, the dev image has all the `blocksds-*`
      packages.

  - Documentation:

    - Update setup instructions.

  - Examples:

    - New example of how to use the ARM7 console to print text on the screen.

## Version 1.7.0 (2024-12-23)

- libnds:

  - An exception handler has been added to the ARM7. This one is a lot less
    useful than the ARM9 one because it's only called on undefined instructions
    and internal libnds errors.
  - Add `dldiRelocate()`, which allows relocating a DLDI driver to a different
    memory address.
  - Fix DLDI memory pointers not being relocated for non-BSS/noinit areas.
  - Update FatFs to R0.15a.
  - `glColorSubTableEXT()` now supports allocating empty palettes by passing a
    NULL pointer in the `table` argument. This is a small compatibility break
    because this used to free the palette. However, the old behaviour stays as
    long as `width` is 0. In most cases, `table` would be NULL and `width` would
    be 0, so this change is only a problem in unusual cases.
  - Disable MPU safely before calling the exit-to-loader ARM9 hook in case the
    hook doesn't do it properly.

- maxmod:

  - Remove non-standard `.struct` directives.

- SDK:

  - picolibc:

    - Add `asnprintf()` and `vasnprintf()`, matching newlib.
    - Fix memory leak in `asprintf()` and `vasprintf()`.

  - ndstool:

    - Add a default icon for new `.nds` files, preventing the generation of invalid
      banners.
    - Add support for extracting static `.nds` icons as `.bmp` files.
    - Allow specifying `-bt` without a language ID.
    - Fix the `-n` (latency) argument being a no-op, add corresponding `-n1` argument.
    - Fix the `-fh` (fix header CRC) command not working with TWL-enhanced `.nds` files.

  - Docker:

    - curl has been added to both the development and slim images.
    - Add new BlocksDS pacman repository during setup.

  - pacman:

    - The pacman server of BlocksDS is now independent from Wonderful Toolchain.

      - The repository with the package build files is now in the BlocksDS
        GitHub organization in this URL: https://github.com/blocksds/packages
      - BlocksDS still uses Wonderful Toolchain as source for the compiler and
        the standard C and C++ libraries. It will keep using wf-pacman for the
        forseeable future as well.
      - Special thanks to asie for all his help.
      - Updating old installations requires the user to run the following
        commands:

        ```bash
        wf-pacman -Sy wf-pacman
        wf-pacman -Syu
        wf-pacman -Syu
        ```

    - New libraries are now available as pacman packages (µLibrary, libwoopsi,
      dsmi) as well as the tool ptexconv.
    - The GitHub pipeline of the SDK repository has been removed and added to
      the packages repository.

  - Documentation:

    - Update documentation with the instructions to use the new pacman
      repository.
    - Some outdated licensing information has been updated.
    - The docs generation script has been split into a script that generates it
      and a script that pushes the built documentation to the repository.
    - The updating guide has been updated for versions between 1.3.0 and 1.7.0.

  - Examples:

    - New example of gesture recognition using the $N Multistroke Recognizer.
    - New example of how to use CMake to build a project with BlocksDS.
    - Update the exception handler example to also support triggering ARM7
      exceptions.

  - Other:

    - BlocksDS now has a dedicated URL (https://blocksds.skylyrac.net/) which
      means that it doesn't rely on GitHub URLs anymore. This main page
      redirects to the documentation, GitHub organization, and a NDS homebrew
      development manual.
    - A new prototype CMake build system has been added to the repository.
    - `CC` makefile variables have been renamed to `HOSTCC` when they refer to
      building host tools. This will make it possible to overwrite the host
      toolchain without also overwriting the ARM toolchain.
    - Use standard C types and fix includes in mkfatimg.
    - bin2c now has an option (`--noext`) that lets it export files excluding
      the extension from the name, the way some very old homebrew projects
      expect it.
    - Some sample defines have been added to the makefiles of the templates to
      clarify its syntax.

## Version 1.6.3 (2024-11-11)

- libnds:

  - Add compile-time warnings about unused result values to various library
    methods.
  - Ensure `nitroFSInit()` checks for successful FAT initialization.
  - Protect the alternate vector base region (`0x0000000` onwards)
    from writing and, if said base is not explicitly enabled, reading.
    This allows catching null pointer accesses at runtime as data aborts.

- SDK:

  - crt0:

    - Fix thread-local storage not being initialized properly during
      global constructor initialization.
    - Fix thread-local storage not being initialized at all on ARM7.

  - picolibc:

    - Add `memset_explicit()`.
    - Improve wctype compatibility.
    - Update ctype case conversion table to Unicode 15.1.0.

  - Toolchain:

    - Update binutils to 2.43.1.
    - The alternate `gold` linker is no longer shipped with the toolchain.

  - Other:

    - Add regression test for `setVectorBase()`.
    - Modify templates to use toolchain `gcc-ar` over host `ar` for
      packaging libraries; this ensures correct operation on systems
      without `binutils` installed, as well as when building libraries
      with link-time optimized objects.
    - Update ARM assembly code to always use UAL syntax.
    - Update official Docker image to Ubuntu 24.04.

## Version 1.6.2 (2024-11-04)

- libnds:

  - Filesystem:

    - Fixed a bug involving incorrect reads of recently written sectors.

- SDK:

  - Changes to examples:

    - Clean the 8-bit double-buffered bitmap example.

  - Other:

    - Improve FAQ and updating guide.

## Version 1.6.1 (2024-11-03)

- libnds:

  - Filesystem:

    - This version was supposed to include a fix for a bug involving incorrect
      reads of recently written sectors, but the submodule wasn't updated
      correctly so the fix was left out.

## Version 1.6.0 (2024-11-03)

- libnds:

  - Peripherals:

    - Add support for the "retail" (ATTiny-based) Motion Pack accelerometer
      to the DS Motion Card/Pak driver.
    - Clean up the DS Motion Card/Pak driver.
    - Fix the DS Motion Card driver not working on DSi consoles.
    - Fix the solar sensor not being detected on Boktai 1 cartridges.
    - Fix `peripheralSlot2SolarScanFast()` not working correctly.

  - GL2D:

    - Fix off-by-one errors when drawing textures with GL2D when the textures
      aren't flipped.
    - Reorganize GL2D setup code to reduce code duplication.

  - Other:

    - Fix return types and improve performance of integer square root helpers.
    - In `initSystem()`, fix video register clearing ranges and remove redundant
      VRAM configuration.
    - The GRF "HDR" RIFF chunk has been deprecated and it has been replaced by
      a new chunk called "HDRX", which is exactly the same, but it includes a
      version field so that it is future-proof.
    - Fix some issues that prevented LLVM from building the library. Add missing
      arguments to UDF instructions in the codebase. Add some explicit casts. Use
      `inttypes.h` definitions in `printf()` instead of explicit size modifiers.
    - Fix undefined behaviour warnings due to left shifts of signed integers.

- grit:

  - Update GRF export code to match the new format used by libnds.

- ndstool:

  - Use `git describe` output as version string instead of a hardcoded outdated
    version number.

- SDK:

  - crt0 and linker script files:

    - It is now possible to place DTCM variables and data at the end of DTCM
      instead of the beginning. This means the stack can grow downwards without
      affecting the variables at the beginning of DTCM. This is done by setting
      the value of the new symbol `__dtcm_data_size` to a non-zero value. The
      linker will helpfully point out if the data area is too small for a given
      program.
    - The user-configurable symbol `__shared_wram_size` has been added.
    - Assertions have been added to check that the user-defined sizes produce
      a valid executable.
    - Support for `.noinit` sections has been added.
    - Missing copyright notices have been added to linker scripts.
    - Minor cleanups and adjustments have been done to the crt0 code.

  - picolibc:

    - Add implementation of `<uchar.h>`.
    - Improve `powf()` accuracy.

  - Documentation:

     - Provide information about the build process of .nds files.
     - Add a FAQ to the documentation.
     - Add IRC channels to the support channels page.
     - Add notes about what to do after installing BlocksDS.
     - Credit all known contributors to all repositories of BlocksDS.

  - Examples:

    - Add NDS Motion card example.
    - Add example of scaling and rotating GL2D sprites.
    - Add `inttypes.h` include in some examples that require it after picolibc
      changes.

## Version 1.5.0 (2024-09-10)

- libnds:

  - Exception handling:

    - Add trivial crash handler to inform the user of unrecoverable error
      conditions, such as stack corruptions with stack smash protection
      enabled.
    - Add trivial release exception handler to inform the user of data aborts
      and other exception conditions even in release builds. This is enabled
      by default; this implementation omits stack and register dumps, making
      the `.nds` size increase negligible.
    - Tweak default exception handler to use a darker red for the background.

  - Filesystem:

    - Fix using Slot-2 direct access on `.nds` files over 32 MB. In particular,
      this fixes accessing large NitroFS filesystems under NO$GBA.

  - GRF loader:

    - Improve performance by using fast `memcpy()` over `swiCopy()`.
    - Rework loader to only read requested chunks from the filesystem,
      as opposed to reading all chunks and filtering them at a later stage.

  - Sound:

    - Add functions to play PSG, noise and sound samples on specific channels.
    - Add `soundCaptureStart` and `soundCaptureStop` high-level helpers for
      the sound capture functionality.

  - Other:

    - Add additional error checks to NitroFS and GRF functions.
    - Add unused result warnings to functions which can cause memory leaks if
      their result is not deallocated.
    - Document high-level DSi camera functions.
    - Fix console 'K' ANSI escape code not clearing characters on the line.
    - Fix includes for the latest picolibc commits.

- SDK:

  - New examples:

    - Add ANSI escape code tests.
    - Add sound capture example.

  - Changes to examples:

    - Add `.MOD` files to LibXM7 examples.
    - Add missing `fclose()` error checks.
    - Adjust examples using GRF files to showcase the loader's built-in
      asset decompression functionality.
    - Clean up camera and LibXM7 examples.

  - picolibc:

    - Add support for C11 Annex K functions (`_s`-suffixed functions).
    - Deprecate BSD-specific `<sys/tree.h>`.
    - Fix handling `NaN` in `scanf()` and `strtod()`.
    - Fix return values for `glob()`.
    - Fix the `FD_ZERO()` macro.
    - Initial support for POSIX.1-2024 in header files.
    - Other minor header file cleanups.
    - Replace `<_ansi.h>` with `<sys/cdefs.h>`.

  - Other:

    - Fix support for placing the Maxmod soundbank file in the NitroFS
      file system.
    - Make the SD card root directory configurable in default Makefile
      templates.
    - Remove Teak LLVM from the `-slim` Docker image. Most people don't need
      this toolchain, as it is in a highly experimental and unmaintained
      state; in addition, removing it from the image does not prevent people
      from installing it on top, but significantly reduces the download size
      for everyone else.
    - Remove usage of `__DATE__` in teaktool.

## Version 1.4.0 (2024-08-08)

- libnds:

  - Console:

    - Fix 'D' ANSI escape code, which was broken in version 1.3.1.
    - Document PrintConsole struct fields. Some of them are only meant to be
      used by libnds, which has been documented.
    - The size of some fields in the console struct has been reduced, and the
      fields have been reordered to reduce padding in the struct. Some fields
      were unused, and they have been removed.
    - Now it's possible to specify the 16-color palette to be used when loading
      custom fonts with their own palette.
    - `fontCharOffset` now works, which means that it is possible to specify
      that a font should be loaded after another font, so that two fonts can use
      the same tile block and save VRAM.
    - In order to be able to specify the palette and the `fontCharOffset`, a new
      function has been created: `consoleInitEx()`.
    - Mark the defaultConsole struct as const. It is needed to keep that data
      untouched because the user may initialize the default console several
      times in a program, and it's important to be able to return to the right
      initial state.
    - Some variables have been made private.
    - When a character outside of the character set of the font is printed, a
      space is now printed instead. Previously, it printed tiles outside of the
      font, which could result in garbage being printed on the screen.
    - New functions have been added to control the console without using awkward
      ANSI escape sequences: `consoleSetCursor()`, `consoleGetCursor()`,
      `consoleAddToCursor()` and `consoleSetColor()`.

  - Keyboard:

    - Make custom keyboards work. This seems to have never worked because libnds
      overwrote the custom keyboard struct with the default keyboard struct.
    - Keyboard struct fields have been refactored. Some field sizes are now
      smaller, some fields are now const. The order has been changed to reduce
      padding between fields and save even more RAM.
    - Ensure that the keyboard is always initialized to the right state with
      `keyboardShow()`. This lets you make a keyboard start in uppercase or
      lowercase state depending on your preferences.
    - Prevent keyboard functions from hanging if no keyboard is actually
      visible.

  - Other:

    - Fix crash when calling `peripheralSlot2InitDefault()` in a DSi retail
      unit. This didn't happen in DS, or in debugger DSi units.
    - Add helper to tell the GPU to apply fog to the clear buffer.
    - Flush RAM before copying console graphics to VRAM.
    - Implement `assert()` in the ARM9 and ARM7. In the ARM9 it works like
      `sassert()`, in the ARM7 it prints a no$gba debug message.
    - Clarify some comments about decompression routines of the BIOS.
    - Stop using ANSI escape sequences everywhere. Use direct console API
      functions instead, which are more self-explanatory.
    - The functions `sysGetCartOwner()` and `sysGetCardOwner()` have been added
      to be able to check the CPU owner of the Slot-1 and Slot-2 buses.
    - Add documentation to some functions without it, and fix some Doxygen
      comments.

- DSWiFi:

  - Stop generating `dswifi_version.h` as part of the build process.
  - Some warnings have been fixed.

- LibXM7:

  - Fix a crash when unloading MOD files.

- ndstool:

  - Fix NitroFS filesystem corruption when no banner is generated.

- grit:

  - Fix `libplum` build error with LLVM.

- mmutil:

  - Fix some incorrect types.

- SDK:

  - New examples:

    - Using fog in a 3D scene.
    - Sorting 3D translucent objects based on their distance to the camera and
      drawing them in the correct order.
    - How to use Maxmod song events.
    - How to stream a WAV file from the filesystem using Maxmod.
    - How to use the sound API of libnds to play PSG, noise and PCM audio.
    - How to use custom keyboards with libnds.

  - Changes to examples:

    - The basic Maxmod example now also shows how to play sound effects.
    - The example that loads custom fonts with the libnds console has been
      improved to load 2 fonts with custom 16-color graphics on one screen and
      one font with 256-color graphics on the other one.
    - Examples and test now don't use ANSI escape sequences. This makes the code
      a lot harder to understand.

  - Other:

    - Add page to the documentation about how to debug programs with libnds.
    - dlditool: Use `stdbool.h` instead of a custom boolean type.
    - Doxygen comments have been reorganized in all repositories so that they
      are uniform across all the codebase.
    - All Doxyfiles have been updated.

## Version 1.3.1 (2024-07-26)

- libnds:

  - Added memory barriers to libnds functions which remap user-accessible
    memory.
  - `consolePrintChar()` has been exposed in the public API. Coupled with
    internal refactors, this allows using the built-in console without
    pulling in printf/scanf as a dependency.
  - Fixed function parameters and improved parameters for BIOS RSA functions.
  - Fixed potential memory corruption when `micStopRecording()` was called
    twice.
  - Fixed regression in new touchscreen driver on CDC (TWL).
  - Improved documentation for the BIOS CRC-16 calculation function.
  - Minor optimizations to videoGL and console code.

- SDK:

  - New examples:

    - Added a 3D billboard drawing example.
    - Added a 3D spot lights example.
    - Added a 3D two-pass rendering example.
    - Added a BIOS bit unpacking example.
    - Added a BIOS CRC-16 calculation example.
    - Added a BIOS RSA decryption example.
    - Added a microphone recording example.
    - Added a Maxmod audio modes example.
    - Added a Maxmod reverb example.
    - Fixed a regression in the exception handler example.

  - picolibc:

    - The bundled version of picolibc has been updated.
    - Added an implementation of `posix_memalign()`.
    - Added support for `%a` and `%A` formats in `scanf()`.
    - Fixed `freopen()` not resetting the unget buffer.
    - Fixed hexadecimal string conversion in `strtod()`, `strtof()` and
      `strtold()`.
    - Fixed `lgammal()` corrupting the application-defined `signgam`
      value.
    - Fixed potential issue when calling `fclose()` more than once.
    - Fixed `printf()` rounding issues for `%a` and `%f` formats.
    - General header cleanups have been performed.

  - Other:

    - Expanded the touch input test to allow sampling input on initial pen
      press only, as opposed to every frame while the pen is touching the
      display.

## Version 1.3.0 (2024-07-06)

- libnds:

  - New touchscreen driver:

    - The touchscreen driver has been rewritten from the ground up.
    - A new routine for filtering measurements is now used for both TSC (NTR)
      and CDC (TWL) touch inputs. This should provide more accurate results,
      particularly on more worn down displays and screen protectors. More
      testing is required, however.
    - On TSC (NTR), `tscMeasure()` now uses the 16-clock-per-conversion method
      to speed up measurement readouts.
    - The duration of the critical (interrupt-blocking) section of the touch
      driver has been reduced, and the TSC (NTR) driver has had its performance
      optimized on top of that compared to 1.2.0 and below.
    - On the ARM7 side, `touchApplyCalibration` and `touchReadData` have been
      added to allow more granular access to the touchscreen driver's logic.
    - As these commands were only intended for TSC (NTR), `touchRead` and
      `touchReadTemperature` were moved to a new header, `tsc.h`, and renamed
      to `tscRead` and `tscReadTemperature` respectively.

  - Interrupt handling:

    - The interrupt dispatcher has been optimized to use `O(1)` as opposed
      to `O(n)` lookups. This is always faster on ARM9, and faster for
      more than 2-3 defined IRQ handlers on ARM7, which is the common
      scenario.
    - Fixed a bug where `irqClearAUX()` would disable the non-auxillary
      interrupt of the same bit mask on ARM7.
    - Fixed behaviour in setting and clearing of multiple interrupt
      handlers at a time (bit masks with more than one bit set). Now,
      setting multiple bits at once with `irqSet()` or `irqClear()` acts
      the same as setting one bit at a time.

  - Memory usage:

    - ITCM use has been reduced by about 320-380 bytes, depending on your
      codebase's use of libnds.
    - DTCM use has been reduced by 192 bytes - the size of the
      reserved section at the end of memory is now 64 bytes by default
      and can be controlled with the `__dtcm_reserved_size` linker
      symbol.
    - ARM7 IWRAM use has been reduced by 192 bytes - the size of the
      reserved section at the end of memory is now 64 bytes by default
      and can be controlled with the `__iwram_reserved_size` linker
      symbol.
    - The size of the supervisor and IRQ stack can now be controlled by
      defining the `__svc_stack_size` and `__irq_stack_size` linker
      symbols.

  - Graphics:

    - A new function has been added to set the object mode (regular, bitmap,
      window, blended): `oamSetBlendMode()`.
    - A new function has been added to get a SpriteSize entry from the size of a
      sprite in pixels: `oamDimensionsToSize()`. Also, `SpriteSize_Invalid` has
      been introduced to represent dimensions that aren't valid 2D sprite sizes.
    - New definitions have been added for the bit fields of the `BLDALPHA` and
      `BLDY` registers.
    - The following functions now return error codes: `glBindTexture()`,
      `glAssignColorTable()`, `glGetColorTableParameterEXT()`, and
      `glTexParameter()`, making it easier to handle errors gracefully when
      using them.
    - There has been a big refactor in videoGL to handle allocation errors
      gracefully (or at least crash with an assertion if the code can't recover
      from the error).

  - Code refactoring:

    - `RTC_CR`, `RTC_CR8` and `HALT_CR` have been renamed to `REG_RTCCNT`,
      `REG_RTCCNT8` and `REG_HALTCNT`, respectively.
    - GL2D now uses existing `videoGL.h` helpers instead of reimplementing
      its own copies.
    - Many fields and functions have been documented, including firmware
      flash commands, DLDI driver structures.
    - Missing `DMA_START` constants have been added.
    - The constants used in `tscReadTemperature` have been documented.
    - `SerialWaitBusy` has been renamed to `spiWaitBusy`.
    - `oamSetGfx()` has been moved away from the header to fix C++ builds.

  - Other:

    - ARM7 SPI bus helper functions have been added: `spiExchange`,
      `spiRead` and `spiWrite`.
    - `consoleLoadFont()` has been cleaned up. Note that the
      `convertSingleColor` option has been removed, as 1bpp fonts are now
      supported.
    - Decompression of Huffman-compressed data has been implemented.
      To faciliate this, `decompressStreamStruct()` has been added.
    - Decompression utility functions are now available in both the
      ARM9 and ARM7 build of libnds.
    - `glCallList()` and `cardStartTransfer()` now use the safe helper
      function `dmaSetParams()`.
    - wf-fatfs has been updated, bringing minor performance improvements
      to directory lookups.
    - The magic numbers used to represent MPU memory regions have been replaced
      by definitions.
    - A missing include has been added to `grf.h`.

- SDK:

  - New examples:

    - Added an 8-bit bitmap background loading example.
    - Added an example of combining 3D, 2D sprite, and 2D background display.
    - Added an example of loading sprites of all graphics types from GRF files.
    - Added an example of loading bitmap sprites.
    - Added an example of loading and using affine sprites.
    - Added examples of using regular windows and windows using objects as mask.
    - Added examples of using extended palettes for sprites and backgrounds.
    - Added an example of using a text console in an extended affine background.
    - Added an example of using the mosaic effect in sprites and backgrounds.
    - Added an example of animating 2D sprites by updating frames in real time
      or by pre-loading all frames to VRAM from the start.
    - Added an example of using 2D alpha blending and fade effects.
    - Added a BIOS decompression example.
    - Added a NitroFS paletted texture loading example.
    - Added a touch input test, and two examples.
    - Added an example of creating graphics effects using the horizontal
      blanking interrupt.
    - Added a sample minigame based on Space Invaders.

  - Changes to examples:

    - OAM memory and textures is now freed in all examples that allocate them.
      While this isn't needed in examples as short as ours, it's good practice
      to show developers how to free resources when they aren't needed anymore.
    - The names of the ROMs and the titles and subtitles in the ROM header have
      been modified to make them consistent across all examples.
    - Background IDs returned by `bgInit()` are now used instead of hardcoded
      layer numbers.
    - `videoSetMode()` is no longer used to enable sprites or to set sprite
      mapping modes, that should be done by the `libnds` sprite API.
    - Tilemaps are now explicitly excluded from grit generation in all the grit
      files that are used to convert sprites.

  - grit:

    - Fixed reading data from assembly files as input.
    - Fixed uninitialized memory use when loading a picture with an odd width.

  - picolibc:

    - The bundled version of picolibc has been updated.
    - Added an implementation of `funopen`.
    - Added bounds checking to `asctime_r` and `ctime_r`.
    - Added implementations of `fgetpos` and `fsetpos`.
    - Added stub implementations for POSIX unlocked file functions.
    - Fixed `fgetwc` and `fputwc` not setting the file stream to wide
      orientation.
    - Fixed `regex.h` not being usable when compiling C++ code.

  - Other:

    - Fixed NitroFS generation in the combined ARM7+ARM9 ROM template.
    - The BlocksDS SDK now depends on the `wf-nnpack` package, which provides
      standalone, command-line compressors for the decompression methods
      supported by the console's BIOS.
    - The code style of `libteak` and `DSWiFi` has been changed using
      `clang-format` to improve readability.
    - The documentation has been updated with additional notes about migrating
      from older and current versions of devkitARM, covering further potential
      issues.
    - The Teak LLVM toolchain is no longer mentioned in the Windows setup
      instructions, as it is not available there.

## Version 1.2.0 (2024-06-08)

- libnds:

  - videoGL:

    - Add `glGetColorTablePointer()` (returns pointer in VRAM to the palette
      of a texture).
    - Add `glGetTextureExtPointer()` (returns pointer in VRAM to the additional
      texture data of `GL_COMPRESSED` textures).
    - Fix allocation of `GL_COMPRESSED` textures when `VRAM_A` is not allocated
      to the 3D engine.
    - Fix crash in `glTexImage2D()` with no active texture.
    - Fix error checking in `glColorTableEXT()` and `glTexImage2D()`.
    - General code cleanup and improvements.
    - Minor optimization to loading `GL_RGB` textures using `glTexImage2D()`.
      Note that using this format is not recommended; see documentation for
      additional details.
    - `TEXTURE_SIZE_INVALID` has been added to GL_TEXTURE_SIZE_ENUM.
    - `glTexImage2D()` now fails correctly when invalid sizes are used.
    - Some minor comment improvements.

  - GL2D:

    - Improve error checking when loading textures.
    - Modify sprite sets to use `uint16_t` arrays for texture
      coordinates.

  - Other:

    - Add `hw_sqrtf()` - a hardware-accelerated alternative to `sqrtf()`.
    - Small optimizations to functions that use the hardware accelerators of
      division and square root.
    - Add support for detecting stack smash canaries.
      - As a result, the debug versions of libnds are now built with
        the stack protector enabled.
    - Add support for printing standard output to the debug console if
      the on-display console is not initialized.
    - Change `SOUND_FREQ` (ARM7) and `TIMER_FREQ` to always return the
      correct frequency value, rounded to the nearest achievable one.
      - This has been found in user research to be the most intuitive
        default; if you'd like alternate options, please let us know.
    - Fix `swiSwitchToGBAMode()`.
    - Improve documentation of RTC structs.

- SDK:

  - Add error code checks to 3D engine examples.
  - Add GL2D spriteset and tileset examples.
  - Add new tool: squeezer (by @huxingyi), used for generating packed textures
    for GL2D sprite sets. It has been forked to easily export formats used by
    GL2D instead of generic formats.
  - Add tests for `hw_sqrtf()`.
  - Avoid using `GL_RGB` and `TEXTURE_SIZE_n` defines in 3D engine examples.
  - Fix VRAM bank setup in "text over 3D" example.
  - Improve timer example.
  - Add a test for the videoGL functions that allocate textures and palettes.

## Version 1.1.0 (2024-05-08)

- libnds:

  - Add `keyboardExit()` function to deinitialize keyboard structures.
  - Add `realpath()` implementation.
  - Adjust `keyboardInit()` to only link the default keyboard if no custom
    keyboard is being used.
  - Fix `getcwd()` result when called in the root NitroFS directory.
  - Fix Slot-1 card reads not being aligned to 512 bytes.
  - Minor allocation/string handling bugfixes.
  - Fix some memory allocation issues found by GCC 14.

- SDK:

  - Add examples (paletted textures, rotation backgrounds, 16-bit backgrounds,
    sprites in sub screen, FAT file attributes, GL2D usage).
  - Add tests for `realpath()`.
  - Fix warnings found by GCC 14 in examples.

## Version 1.0.0 (2024-03-30)

- libnds:

  - Fix C++ builds (there was a missing cast from enum to int, and the Makefile
    was using the wrong program to link binaries).
  - Optimize some videoGL functions (compile them as ARM instead of Thumb to
    take advantage of the faster multiplication instructions).
  - Fix bug in `readdir()`.
  - Implement `__retarget_lock_*()` family of functions to allow libc functions
    to work in a multithreaded environment.
  - Make `glCallList()` take a `void` pointer instead of `u32`.
  - Add checks to NWRAM functions to see if MBK1-MBK5 are writable.
  - Don't remap NWRAM-A when starting the DSP (only B and C are needed).
  - Fix `swiUnpackBits()`.
  - Fix some casts to respect "const".
  - Fix some warnings.
  - Improve some documentation comments.
  - Deprecate typedef `fp` (the name is too short!) and `PUnpackStruct`.
  - Add missing files to the Doxygen documentation.

- SDK:

  - Add examples (3D object picking, 3D toon shading, building 3D display lists,
    3D volumetric shadows, compressed textures, orthogonal projections, using
    console windows with the default console API).
  - Improve C++ test to prevent regressions like during the last few versions.
  - Document memory map of the DS.
  - Add note about the Makefiles of BlocksDS not supporting paths outside of the
    root folder of the project (thanks, @lifehackerhansol).
  - Fix linking C++ projects in default makefiles.

- Maxmod:

  - Fix return type of `mmEffectCancel()` in ARM9 code.

## Version 0.14.0 (2024-03-02)

- libnds:

  - The GRF loading functions have been modified to be actually useful. In some
    cases it wasn't possible to infer the size of some data chunks of the file
    (it was impossible to calculate the size of a tileset, for example). The new
    functions break compatibility with the old ones, but this change was
    required.
  - Added `glTexSizeToEnum()` to convert sizes in pixels to `GL_TEX_SIZE_ENUM`
    values. Also, the funciton `glTexImage2D()` now accepts sizes in pixels as
    well as `GL_TEX_SIZE_ENUM` values.
  - Added a function to return the default drive (`sd:` in the case of DSi,
    `fat:` in the case of a DS).
  - FatFs has been moved to an external repository (wf-fatfs) which is included
    in libnds as a submodule. The documentation of FatFs has been removed from
    this repository.
  - Added some missing 3D polygon attribute definitions.
  - Fixed the return type of `swiSHA1Verify()`.
  - The `fatfs.h` header has been removed, it is redundant.

- SDK:

  - Refactor documentation.
    - It now uses Hugo, and it is available as a static website.
    - Some old sections have been updated.
    - The documentation of all libraries has been integrated with the
      documentation of BlocksDS so that everything is linked.
    - Document how to use Slot-2 flashcarts with BlocksDS applications.
    - Reword devkitARM porting guide.
    - A doxygen theme has been applied to the documentation of all the libraries
      used by BlocksDS.

  - Add lots of examples:
    - 3D and 2D graphics.
    - DSWifi.
    - How to use multiple DSP binaries in the same application
    - General NitroFS usage in an application (such as loading music for LibXM7
      or graphics to be used as 2D backgrounds or sprites).
    - DSi SHA1 functions.
    - Hardware timers.
    - Video capture (render to texture, dual screen 3D, save screenshot as PNG).
    - More text console examples.

  - Small change to makefiles that modifies the destination folder of build
    artifacts.

- LibXM7:

  - It now uses timer 0 instead of timer 1, so that Maxmod and LibXM7 use the
    same timer and it's easier to switch libraries.
  - The documentation has been improved.

- DSWifi:

   - WEP modes have been documented.
   - The prototypes of some functions have been cleaned up.
   - The documentation has been improved.

- Maxmod:

   - The return type of `mmEffectCancel()` has been fixed.
   - Some definitions have been turned into enums.
   - `inline` functions in headers have been turned into `static inline.`

## Version 0.13.0 (2024-02-01)

- libnds:

  - Breaking change: Refactor input handling in the ARM9. In order to fix a race
    condition where the touch screen state could be updated between calls to
    `scanKeys()` and `touchRead()` it has become mandatory to call
    `scanKeys()` before `touchRead()`, `keyboardGetChar()`,
    `keyboardUpdate()` and the deprecated `touchReadXY()`. Most programs
    are already doing this, but this may break a small number of programs that
    don't do it.
  - Implemented `isHwDebugger()`, which returns 1 if the console running the
    code is a hardware debugger, regardless of the DS model and CPU state. This
    is meant to replace `swiIsDebugger()`, which only works if the cache is
    disabled, and only in DS models (not DSi). The documentation of
    `swiIsDebugger()` has been updated to mention its limitations.
  - Fix Slot-2 tilt API introduced in version 0.11.0, which hadn't been tested
    on hardware. The old `peripheralSlot2TiltUpdate()` has been replaced by
    `peripheralSlot2TiltStart()` and `peripheralSlot2TiltRead()`.
  - Implemented `utime()` and `utimes()` for changing file modification
    dates.
  - Implemented `scandir()`, `alphasort()` and `versionsort()`,
  - Fixed `statvfs()` and `fstatvfs()` on NitroFS paths and files.
  - Added stubs for `getwd()` and `get_current_dir_name()`.
  - Added stubs for `getuid()`, `getgid()`, etc.
  - Add helpers to load GRF files generated by grit.
  - Reintroduce logic to read Slot-1 cartridges with card commands from the ARM7
    to save CPU cycles on the ARM9.
  - The value of the RAM size field in `REG_SCFG_EXT` in the ARM9 is now set
    to 16 MB or 32 MB instead of being fixed to 32 MB even in retail DSi units.
  - Some CP15 defines have been fixed.
  - Simplify logic in ARM7 input handler.
  - Generate default font from a PNG at build time instead of doing it from a
    preconverted BIN file to make it easier to replace it in the future.

- grit:

  - Added the `-D` argument, specifying the destination folder for
    non-shared data as a counterpart to `-O`.
  - Fixed a situation in which the first color in an image's palette would be
    used as transparent if the user-provided color (with `-gT`) was not
    present in the image.
  - Breaking change: Fixed GRF file output to properly follow the RIFF chunk
    format. It will also export new information in the file header, like using
    special magic values to specify the formats A3I5, A5I3 and TEX4x4, and
    specifying the number of colors contained in the palette (for 16-bit
    textures it's 0). In order for the new information to fit in the header,
    some fields have been increased in size.
  - Fixed palette size calculation for DS textures.
  - Improvements to error messages.

- LibXM7:

  - Make types `XM7_XMModuleHeader_Type` and `XM7_MODModuleHeader_Type`
    private. Developers consider their MOD/XM files as a typeless blob of data,
    they shouldn't need to cast it to anything, the library should do it itself.
  - The structs that define the MOD and XM formats have been made private, as
    well as some definitions internal to the player.
  - Some defines have been turned into enums, which will help developers and
    IDEs identify what to use in which functions.
  - The documentation has been updated.

- Tests:

  - Add test to read DSi SCFG registers to see which DSi features are available
    with the loader that has been used to launch the application.
  - Add test to display all configured MPU regions.

## Version 0.12.0 (2023-12-26)

- libnds:

  - Dot and dot-dot entries are now properly emitted in readdir(). In line
    with common software expectations, they mirror standard FAT filesystem
    behaviour, that is are present for all subdirectories. For NitroFS,
    these entries are emulated accordingly.
  - The `d_ino` field in `readdir()` output is now correctly populated, to
    match `stat()` and `fstat()`.
  - Added `nitroFSOpenById()` and `nitroFSFopenById()` functions, allowing
    opening files directly without paying the cost of a directory lookup.
  - Accordingly, NitroFS file systems which contain a FAT table but no FNT
    table can now be opened.
  - Optimized `glMaterialShinyness()`.

- SDK:

  - The default Makefiles have been simplified and now use compiler-provided
    `.specs` files. In turn, a few additional features have been added:
    - Support for picolibc's compiler define-based selection of the printf
      and scanf implementations.
    - The `__BLOCKSDS__` define, which can be used to detect a BlocksDS
      environment during building.
  - Fixed camera initialization with the default ARM7 binary.

- grit:

  - Added the `-ftB` argument, which outputs files with `.img`, `.map`,
    `.meta`, `.pal` extensions, as opposed to `.img.bin`, `.map.bin`,
    `.meta.bin` and `.pal.bin`.

## Version 0.11.3 (2023-12-04)

- libnds:

  - Added helpers to control microphone power independently from recording.
    This can be used for scenarios in which the DSP is tasked from recording
    microphone input.
  - Added helpers and definitions for the DSi GPIO registers.
  - Added function to detect availability of NWRAM.
  - Fixed `atexit()` handlers not being called during a normal `main()`
    return.
  - Fixed TSC configuration for enabling 47 kHz input/output in DSi mode.
  - Improved error handling in Teak DSP code execution helpers.
  - The Teak DSP is now powered off before loading a DSP binary.

- DSWiFi:

  - Reduced memory usage, especially while Wi-Fi is not initialized.

- ndstool:

  - Breaking: Instead of providing alternate-language banner text using
    `-bt5 "Text"`, the form `-bt 5 "Text"` is now required.
  - Added support for providing mutliple root directories for building NitroFS
    images. All specified root directories are combined to create the root of
    the file system.
  - Fixed `-w` treating other options as file masks.
  - Improved argument handling.

- SDK:

  - Updated compiler flags:
    - The superfluous `-mtune=arm7tdmi` has been removed from ARM7 Makefiles.
    - `-march=armv5te -mtune=arm946e-s` has been replaced with
      `-mcpu=arm946e-s+nofp` in ARM9 Makefiles.
    - `-Wl,--use-blx` has been added to ARM9 linker flags. This allows the
      use of the BLX opcode for linking ARM/Thumb code in place of trampolines,
      slightly improving final executable size and performance.

## Version 0.11.2 (2023-11-27)

- libnds:

  - Fixed a bug introduced in version 0.11.1 that didn't initialize audio
    hardware correctly in DSi mode.
  - Some superfluous audio helpers added in version 0.11.1 have been removed.
  - Move libteak to its own repository so that it can be reused by other
    toolchains.
  - Modify functions to load DSP binaries to return int instead of bool for more
    flexibility.

- DSP:

  - Move crt0 and linkerscript to libteak repository.
  - Preprocess all assembly files, not just the crt0.

## Version 0.11.1 (2023-11-25)

- libnds:

  - Fixed an edge case which could read to invalid small reads/writes to
    DSi/ARM7-controlled removable storage.
  - Added helpers to control `REG_SNDEXTCNT` from the ARM9 (to enable DSP
    audio output to the speakers, for example).
  - Some DSP functions have been moved to `twl` sections to save memory when
    the game runs in a regular DS.
  - Wrapped camera functions to prevent crashes when used in NDS mode.
  - Change license of DLDI-related files to Zlib with permission from the
    authors.
  - Fix Doxygen documentation of peripherals.

- DSP:

  - Added BTDMP helpers to stream audio from the DSP to the speakers. Added an
    example to show how to generate audio from the ARM7 and the DSP at the same
    time.
  - Added an example of how to use DMA to transfer data from the DSP memory to
    the ARM9 memory.

## Version 0.11.0 (2023-11-19)

- libc:

  - Fixed an important regression in `memcpy()` and `memset()` implementations.

- Improved file I/O performance:

  - Added support for batch reads and writes of contiguous clusters, improving
    SD card performance for very large sequential reads/writes.
  - Added `fatInitLookupCacheFile()`. This allows opting a file into having a
    special in-memory cache which significantly speeds up file seek operations.
  - Provisionally automatically enabled the in-memory cache for NitroFS files.
    If you're experiencing slowdowns, make sure to defragment your SD card -
    this requirement will be loosened in future releases (but it's still a good
    idea).
  - Integrated profi200's [dsi\_sdmmc](https://github.com/profi200/dsi_sdmmc)
    driver, improving reliability and performance for reading from and writing
    to the DSi's SD card.
  - Optimized unaligned buffer I/O performance for the DSi's SD card.
  - Only cluster table/directory-related reads will now be cached by the
    built-in sector cache. This allows better use of this sector cache; one can
    use `setvbuf()` to enable a larger cache for file I/O.
  - Other minor optimizations have been made throughout the code.

- Added a new Slot-2 API (`arm9/peripherals/slot2.h`).

  - Added support for detecting external RAM cartridges (SuperCard, M3, G6, DS
    Memory Expansion Pak, EZ-Flash variants, EverDrive).
  - Added support for enabling and disabling the data cache on the Slot-2 memory
    area. Combined with suitable bus speed detection for these cartridges, this
    allows efficient usage of such an external RAM area.
  - Added support for detecting and using the Gyro, Solar and Tilt sensors
    available on various GBA game cartridges.
  - Fixed detection of GBA cartridge rumble (WarioWare, Drill Dozer).
  - Modify rumble example to show how to use the new API.

- DLDI:

  - Moved the built-in sector cache into unused memory occupied by the reserved
    DLDI driver area. This effectly saves ~20KB of heap RAM for most homebrew.
  - The DLDI driver area size can now be changed by defining the `__dldi_size`
    symbol to a value away from the default of `16384`, such as `8192` (if
    your application is highly RAM-constrained - this may break support with
    some cartridges, however) or `32768` (restores compatibility with MoonShell
    versions at the cost of an additional 16KB of RAM).
  - The DLDI driver area is now guaranteed to be close to the beginning of the
    `.nds` file, which may slightly improve load times.

- DSP:

  - Add BTDMP and ICU helpers.
  - Refactor `crt0.s`.
  - Add examples of handling interrupts, including timer interrupts.

- libnds:

  - Rename some cache helpers for consistency.
  - Fixed a file handle leak that could occur if `nitroFSInit()` was pointed to
    an .nds file which does not contain a NitroFS file system.
  - Fixed a rare case in which `nitroFSInit()` could try reading from the GBA
    slot on the DSi, causing an exception.
  - Added `readFirmwareJEDEC()` function to read the ID of the DS firmware flash
    chip. (lifehackerhansol)
  - Minor optimizations have been done to `readUserSettings()`.
  - Fixed the `NDMA_DST_FIX` macro definition.

## Version 0.10.2 (2023-11-11)

- NitroFS: Fix file traversal not working without running a `chdir()` first.

## Version 0.10.1 (2023-11-11)

- Fix NitroFS directory reads occasionally failing on non-DLDI environments.

## Version 0.10.0 (2023-11-11)

- Build system:

  - The default makefiles no longer rely on the toolchain being in the current
    `PATH`. Now, the default Makefiles have the default path to Wonderful
    Toolchain, which can be overriden by the user if desired.
  - The makefiles used by the tests and examples have been moved to a system
    location so that they are more easily reused.
  - dldipatch has replaced dlditool as the default to apply DLDI patches, due to
    bugs in dlditool's patch application process:
    https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek-ds-cart-dldi-driver-guessed-address-adjustments.htm
  - Update your makefiles to take advantage of the updates.

- Filesystem improvements:

  - Replaced NitroFAT by a new Zlib-licensed implementation of the NitroFS
    filesystem by @asiekierka. This fixes the performance drawbacks of NitroFAT.
  - In `stat()` and `fstat()`, the fields `st_dev` and `st_ino` are now
    properly populated.
  - Fixed `stat()` not acknowledging `/` as a directory.
  - Remove NitroFAT support from ndstool.
  - The example makefiles have been modified to stop using mkfatimg.

- DSP:

  - Initial **experimental, incomplete** support for the Teak DSP of the DSi.
    This isn't ready to be used, it's still under development and it's going
    through a lot of changes. Most of the code is derived from @Gericom's
    prototype code.
  - Support for building DSP binaries won't be present on Windows until it's
    more stable. However, if you already have pre-built DSP binaries, it's
    possible to use them on Windows.
  - Introduced teaktool, which converts ELF files into TLF (Teak Loadable
    Format) files that can be loaded by libnds.
  - Added ARM9 functions to libnds to handle the DSP, load TLF files and
    communicate with programs running on the DSP.
  - Introduce libteak, a library with helpers to use the AHBM, DMA, APBP, ICU
    and timer peripherals. It has been documented and added to the Doxygen pages
    of libnds.
  - Added a few examples of how to use the currently supported DSP features.
  - Update user instructions and Dockerfile to use and mention the LLVM Teak
    toolchain.
  - Add NWRAM defintions and helpers.

- DLDI improvements:

  - The DLDI template now automatically calculates the "size" and "fix flags"
    fields of the header.
  - The binary R4 DLDI driver, used for DeSmuMe compatibility, has been replaced
    by a Zlib-licensed impementation built from source.

- libnds:

  - Microphone samples can now be captured using full 16-bit precision on DSi.
  - Cleaned up and added some missing MMIO/bitfield defines throughout libnds.
  - Implemented inlined BIOS calls based on gba-hpp. This should make code
    using BIOS calls slightly smaller and faster.
  - Small reorganization of syscalls code.
  - Slightly optimized coroutine threading code.
  - Added documentation about ARM7 audio helpers.

- Submodules:

  - Before this version, repositories owned by third parties were added as
    submodules to the SDK repository. This can be a problem if the owner isn't
    responsive, changes name, deletes the repository... In order to avoid
    issues, forks have been created under the BlocksDS organization. It is
    expected to contribute to the original repositories and update the fork to
    stay in sync. Contributing to the forks is a last resort option.

- Tests:

  - Added a new test for SWI functions.

## Version 0.9.1 (2023-10-19)

- Revert changes in Maxmod that duplicated some symbols.

## Version 0.9.0 (2023-10-18)

- SDK:

  - Native windows support added. Wonderful toolchains now distribute native
    Windows binaries, and the only required change in BlocksDS was to change a
    library used by Grit. Thank you, Generic and asie!
  - The stdio implementation of picolibc provided by Wonderful Toolchains has
    been patched by asie and this has substantially improved direct SD card read
    and write speeds.
  - The RTC interrupt is no longer used in any test, example or template. Users
    are now expected to timer interrupt instead because the RTC interrupt isn't
    supported on 3DS in DS/DSi mode or most emulators. Check the new code to see
    how to adapt old code. The RTC interrupt functions will still be supported
    to preserve compatibility with old projects that aren't updated.
  - Document the ARM9 <-> ARM7 boot synchronization routine.
  - In the dockerfile, set a locale to be able to pass UTF-8 characters to
    ndstool to appear in the title of the NDS ROM.
  - Add a test to ensure that the libnds modules that use the ARM9 <-> ARM7
    transfer memory region don't break.
  - New examples:
    - Getting key input state.
    - Using NitroFAT, DLDI and DSi SD in the same program.
    - Send a buffer in main RAM to the ARM7 from the ARM9.
    - Read battery status.
    - Set the real time clock of the NDS.

- libnds:

  - RTC:
    - Add new helpers to get and set the date. They use typedefs to move values
      between functions instead of byte arrays.
    - The old helpers that use byte arrays have been deprecated.
    - Using the RTC interrupt as a way to update the time every second has been
      deprecated.
  - Documentation:
    - Document values returned by the battery read function.
    - Document RTC helpers.
    - Add some ARM7 modules to the front page of the Doxygen documentation.
  - Memory:
    - Disable data cache and instruction fetch access to DTCM.
    - Rumble detection functions won't try to detect anything on DSi.
    - Change location of transfer region area on DSi so that it's uncached.
    - Import safe DMA helpers written by Gericom and use them from all DMA
      helpers.
  - Video:
    - Make `glGetInt()` wait for the GPU to be idle when getting the polygon
      and vertices count. It is common for developers to forget to wait.
    - Cleanup some helpers and add some missing VRAM definitions.
    - Document hardware bug of the DMA in GFX FIFO mode.
  - Other:
    - FatFs updated to R0.15p3.
    - Support the debug button (only available in emulators and debug consoles).
    - Switch to using ARM unified syntax (UAL).

- Grit:

  - Switch from libfreeimage to libplum. This allows us to build Grit on Windows
    easier.

## Version 0.8.1 (2023-08-01)

- libnds:

  - Fixed NitroFAT in emulators. It only worked when DLDI was initialized
    correctly, which isn't the case in emulators like no$gba.
  - Set the right CPU as owner of the Slot-1 bus in NitroFAT handling functions.

- SDK:

  - Updated build systems to generate Maxmod soundbanks in the NitroFAT
    filesystem if the filesystem is used. This isn't supported by ARM9 + ARM7
    makefiles for now, only by ARM9 makefiles.
  - Fixed segmentation fault in mkfatimg when not enough arguments are
    provided.
  - Stop relying on `make -j` in Makefiles. It is passed by make to any
    sub-make, so it isn't required.
  - Added basic Maxmod and Maxmod + NitroFAT examples.

## Version 0.8 (2023-07-16)

- libnds:

  - Filesystem:
    - `fatInit()` now correctly sets the current working directory.
    - NitroFAT now changes directory to `nitro:/` on initialization.
    - Fixed code that selects the default filesystem (DSi SD or DLDI).
  - Added asynchronous math functions to suplement the synchronous functions.
  - Added support for redirecting `stdout` and `stderr` to user functions.
  - Added support for more rumble packs.
  - Improved support for DSi regions in `guruMeditationDump()`.
  - Documented MPU setup code properly.
  - Cleaned up exception handling code.
  - Added missing `DLDI_SIZE_2KB` define.
  - Fixed leaking file handlers in `truncate()`.
  - Fixed memory leaks and handling in `image` and `pcx` modules.

- ndstool:

  - Fixed warnings.
  - Removed non-homebrew-related functionality.

- SDK:

  - Automatically link with libc and libstdc++ rather than forcing users to do
    it explicitly.
  - Support `*.arm.c` and `*.arm.cpp` filenames for compatibility with
    devkitARM-utilizing projects.
  - Fixed TLS initialization on the ARM7.
  - Improved bin2c.
  - Updated libc documentation.
  - Improved and cleanup some examples.

## Version 0.7 (2023-04-19)

- libnds:

  - Keyboard:
    - Fixed initialization glitch where it could blink for a frame.
    - Fixed backspace handling.
    - Added support for non-blocking keyboard capture when using cothreads.
  - cothread:
    - Fixed stack alignment.
    - Fixed the stack size of the scheduler thread.
  - Fixed no$gba debug messages on the ARM9.
  - Added support of no$gba debug messages to the ARM7.
  - Implemented `fatInit()`.
  - Improved `sassert()` so that it can exit to the loader instead of locking
    the application.
  - Unified all coding and documentation style of the codebase.
  - Changed license of GL2D to Zlib (with the author's permission).
  - Reduced the size of `OamState` structures.

- mmutil:

  - Fixed segfault with samples with implied zero loop.

- SDK:

  - Improved some old examples. Fix memory leaks in all examples that used
    `getcwd()`.
  - Fixed ARM9 linkerscript to place ITCM sections in ITCM correctly.
  - Added new examples: Exception handling, assertions, no$gba debug console.
  - Prevent mkfatimg from generating FAT images that are so small that FatFs
    can't mount them.
  - Improved installation instructions.

## Version 0.6 (2023-04-11)

- SDK:

  - Added a DLDI driver template.
  - Refactored `install` targets of the SDK components. Now, all components
    can be installed on their own, and they copy the licenses of the components
    to the installation directory.
  - Tweak bin2c behaviour to more closely match devkitPro's bin2s.
  - Use SPDX license identifiers in all libraries and components that end up in
    the NDS application binary.
  - Some cleanup of code formatting.

- **libnds**:

  - FIFO subsystem:
    - The FIFO subsystem has been cleaned up and documented.
    - Some bugs in the FIFO subsystem have been fixed (the stress test still
      fails, though).
    - Prevent using `cothread_yield()` in the ARM7.
  - Alignment of thread local storage sections has been fixed.
  - Added support for calling `stat()` on the root directory of a filesystem.
  - Added support for `statvfs()` and `fstatvfs()`.
  - Avoid pulling in the default keyboard data when stdin-requesting code is
    used. This saves over 10 KB of data in any situation where the default
    keyboard is not used (no keyboard or non-default keyboard alike).
  - Allow setting the duration of the lid sleep check, and to disable it
    completely.
  - Build release versions of the library as well as debug.
  - Document MPU setup steps and CP15 registers.
  - Enable more warnings in the Makefile and fix them.

- ndstool:

  - Support multiple languages in the banner.
  - Support more file formats for icons (GIF, PNG).
  - Support animated icons (from GIF files).

## Version 0.5 (2023-03-31)

- SDK:

  - Defined a default location for BlocksDS: `/opt/blocksds/`
  - LibXM7 has been integrated as a core library.
  - Use mkfatimg (distributed with FatFs) instead of `imgbuild.sh` to reduce
    the number of dependencies.
  - Fixed mmutil target in Makefiles in parallel builds.

- libnds:

  - Peripherals:
    - Improved rumble peripheral handling (including detection of the DS Rumble
      Pak).
    - Cleaned up `REG_EXMEMCNT` initialization for the Guitar Grip and Paddle
      peripheral drivers.
  - Improved error recovery in `glInit()`. This allows recovering the
    geometry engine from certain situations where a program exited in the
    middle of 3D engine processing.
  - Improved error recovery in `getcwd()`.
  - Fixed and simplified exit to loader code on the ARM7 side.
  - Improved documentation of exit to loader logic and `BoxTest()`.

## Version 0.4 (2023-03-26)

- SDK:

  - Use the Wonderful Toolchain to get full C++ standard library support.
    - As a result, BlocksDS now targets a specific version of binutils, gcc and
      picolibc.
    - Removed picolibc and avr-libstdcpp as submodules (all previous history has
      been condensed to one commit).
  - Simplified the build system of tests and examples.

- **libnds**:

  - Multithreading:
    - Added cooperative multithreading scheduler.
    - Enabled scheduler in the ARM9 by default.
    - Added examples of having multiple threads, mutexes, and asynchronous file
      loading.
    - Added support for thread-local storage.
    - Added mutexes to FIFO handling and removable storage accesses.
  - Added initial support and example of DSi camera (thanks, asie!).
  - Added support for `malloc()` on the ARM7.
  - Implemented stubs for `fchmod()`, `fchmodat()`, `fchown()`,
    `fchownat()`. `readlink()`, `symlink()`, `getentropy()`.
  - Updated FatFS to R0.15p2.
  - Fixed `glTexImage2D()` not flushing textures before copying them with DMA.

## Version 0.3.1 (2023-03-20)

- libnds:

  - Restored support of `gettimeofday()` on the ARM7.

## Version 0.3 (2023-03-20)

- SDK:

  - Added some tests.
  - Build system improvements (support two-line app titles, remove old makefiles).
  - libsysnds has been integrated in libnds.

- libnds:

  - Implemented a disk cache to improve FatFs performance.
  - Added support for handling DLDI in the ARM7, as opposed to only the ARM9.
    - This is currently controlled either using an additional, previously unused
      bit in the DLDI specification, or explicitly requested by the homebrew
      program.
  - Added function for the ARM9 to request the ARM7 to read the cartridge.
  - Added some missing definitions of DSi registers (SCFG/NDMA).
  - Improved TWL/DSi interrupt support.
  - Improved data cache handling for removable storage read/writes.
  - Fixed detecting certain types of 128 KB cart EEPROMs.
  - Fixed incorrect size detection for certain cases of cart EEPROM data.
  - Tweaked default keyboard texture to make the keycap legends opaque.
  - General cleanup of libnds code (like replacing magic numbers by defines).
  - Fixed `consoleDemoInit()` to restore display brightness when initializing.

## Version 0.2 (2023-03-15)

- SDK:

  - Improved C++ support (now the C++ standard library it is actually usable).
  - Improved C library support.
  - Fixed `install` target.

- libnds:

  - Integrated agbabi renamed as ndsabi. This provides fast implementations of
    `memcpy()`, `memmove()`, `memset()`, helper functions for facilitating
    coroutines, etc.
  - Implemented support for 1BPP fonts in `consoleLoadFont()` and replaced
    `default_font.bin` with a derivative of [Unscii](http://viznut.fi/unscii),
    limited to ASCII characters 32-127. In total, this saves ~7.25 KB of code
    size for any program using the built-in console.
  - Reduced the size of data structures controlling the built-in keyboard.
  - Implemented missing bounds checks in `keyboardGetKey()`.

## Version 0.1 (2023-03-14)

First beta release of BlocksDS. Features:

- SDK:

  - Supports libnds, Maxmod, DSWiFi.
  - Supports a lot of the standard C library.
  - Very early support of the standard C++ library.
  - Supports DLDI, DSi SD slot and NitroFAT (open source alternative of NitroFS)
    using Elm's FatFs.
  - Documentation on how to migrate projects to BlocksDS.
  - Docker image provided.

- libnds:

  - Added new CP15 control helpers for the ARM9.
  - Added Z1/Z2 read support for the TWL/DSi touch screen controller.
    This allows measuring an approximation of pressure, similar to NTR/NDS mode.

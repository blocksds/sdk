Mod Archive Upload Terms, Conditions and License Agreement

Version 2.2 as of April 29th, 2009

This Agreement describes the legal relationship between you (an individual
providing material by uploading songs or other files to the modarchive.org/com
server) and the modarchive.org/com server operators ("us", "we" in the following
text). Please read this document carefully. As this document is modified, the
new version will apply to any files uploaded later than that date, but will not
be applicable to previously uploaded files (see section 3.3).

Section 1: Copyright holders

    1.1, General license. By providing a song/file to us, if you are the
    copyright holder of the song/file in question, you agree to grant us a
    non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-retractable non-terminable, worldwide
    license to: a) Distribute your song/file on the modarchive.org/com web site
    or in any other form of distribution that we deem appropriate. b) Publicly
    display, publicly perform, broadcast, encode, transmit, reproduce,
    manufacture and distribute your song/file in whole or in part, alone or in
    compilation with content provided by third parties, through any medium now
    known or hereafter devised. c) Apply non-destructive and non-changing
    compression systems to decrease the file sizes of the files uploaded to us.

    1.2, License to redistribute. By providing a song/file to modarchive.org/com
    you furthermore agree to give anyone who wishes to redistribute your
    song/file a license to download the song/file from modarchive.org/com and do
    so, provided it has stayed in its original, unmodified, unbundled form.

    Note: If you are visitor looking for information about using modules in your
    productions i.e games/applications, please see the Licensing FAQ in file
    mod-archive-faq.txt.

    1.3, Ownership of Copyrights. You retain ownership of the copyrights and all
    other rights in the song/file provided to us, subject only to the
    non-exclusive rights granted to us under this Agreement. You are free to
    grant similar rights to others.


Section 2: Non-copyright holders

    2.1 License. By providing a song/file to us if you are not the copyright
    holder of said song/file, you agree that you have previously secured a
    license to redistribute the song, according to the terms of Section 1.

    2.2 Copyright infringement. Furthermore you agree that you are fully
    responsible for your action of providing the song to modarchive.org/com, and
    that modarchive.org/com may hold you liable for any copyright infringement
    caused by your uploading of the song/file to the modarchive.org/com server,
    and thus that modarchive.org/com should not be held liable for any
    consequences of your actions.


Section 3: General terms and conditions

    See file mod-archive-terms.txt.

Section 4: Footnotes

    4.1 Works in the public domain. Materials that have previously been
    distributed under public domain license (for example, PD Disk Distributors)
    are quite legal to upload to our servers as long as the material has not
    been modified from its original state since release. Any works submitted to
    The Mod Archive that are not uploaded by their creators or copyright holders
    are assumed to be released into the public domain prior to upload and
    therefore legally licensed for redistribution as Public Domain material by
    The Mod Archive. Materials that have been uploaded but have been modified
    since origin are submitted entirely at the uploaders own risk, where all
    liabilities remain with the uploader concerning any legal implications that
    arise from subsequent litigation should there be any incident where a party
    has cause to complain.

    4.2 Footnote disclaimer. Should any section of the footnoted contradict the
    previous paragraphs in sections 1-3 inclusive, the paragraphs in sections
    1-3 inclusive take precedence.

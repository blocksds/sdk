# Background type loading from NitroFS

This example shows how to load background graphics from NitroFS. The PNG files
are converted to GRF format, which is loaded at runtime.

The build system used is [ArchitectDS](https://codeberg.org/blocksds/architectds)
because of the flexibility it gives the user.

In order to build this example, run:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

To clean the build results, run:

```bash
python3 build.py --clean
```

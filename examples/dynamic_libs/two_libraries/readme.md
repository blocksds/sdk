# Loading two dynamic libraries

This example shows how to load two different dynamic libraries that are stored
in NitroFS.

The build system used is [ArchitectDS](https://codeberg.org/blocksds/architectds)
because of the flexibility it gives the user.

In order to build this example, run:

```bash
python3 build.py
```

To clean the build results, run:

```bash
python3 build.py --clean
```
